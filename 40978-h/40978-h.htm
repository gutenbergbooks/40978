      I had written a considerable part of another work, containing strictures
      on religion. The appearance of the Bishop of Llandaff's pamphlet, and the
      number of editions that have been published for the purpose of encouraging
      its sale among the poorer classes, induced me to take up the pen expressly
      in answer to this publication, that I might undeceive the multitude, and
      show that, under the imposing title of a Bishop, Dr. Watson has been
      guilty of the most gross misrepresentations, and, whether intentionally or
      from ignorance, has deceived his readers, while, under the pretence of
      meekness, he triumphs in the detection of a few errors, committed by a man
      who does not pretend to be a Theologian, or to be possessed of any great
      learning. He has uniformly passed over the weighty arguments of the Age of
      Reason, and stopped at a few immaterial inaccuracies. I hope, in the
      following sheets, to show, that the learned Professor of Divinity has
      committed errors in the Natural Sciences and History, which would be
      inexcusable in any author; but, when coming from a dignified Clergyman,
      who wishes to dictate to the nation, their detection cannot fail to show
      to the public, how necessary it is for men to employ their faculty of
      reason, and not to yield it to those whose profession is to teach things
      they acknowledge to be above reason, and incomprehensible. I shall, as
      soon as my other avocations permit, give the world a tract upon religion
      in general, with strictures on the Jewish and Christian systems. For this
      reason, I shall not, in the present pamphlet, enter deeply into any
      abstract reasoning, but confine myself chiefly to the detection of the
      errors contained in the Apology for the Bible.

      LETTER I.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MY LORD,
    </h3>
    <p>
      You have thought it not inconsistent with your dignity as a Bishop, to
      oppose the <i>Age of Reason by Thomas Paine</i>, and I, as a member of the
      community, find myself called upon to expose your reasoning, and stop the
      career of error. You disclaim controversy; but if your candour is any
      thing more than a vain boast, I entertain hopes of seeing the defender of
      Christianity again step forward to answer my arguments, if he deems them
      of sufficient weight to disturb his quiet. I am sincerely glad to find a
      dignified churchman begin a dispute with men, whom formerly the pious
      members of the Church would have deemed fit victims for the fire or the
      gallows; at the same time, I feel deep regret, that the Bishop has not yet
      altogether laid aside the clerical passion for the extermination of the
      heterodox. I hope, says Dr. Watson, that there is no want of charity in
      wishing, that Mr. Paine's life had been terminated long before his
      publication. This may be consistent with Christian charity, but nature and
      reason teach us ugly unbelievers another doctrine: and, however inveterate
      I may be against those of the clergy who persecute and deceive the
      multitude, I confess, that the death of a person, whom I conceive to be
      acting for what he thinks the public good, would give me no pleasure; and
      the Bishop allows the purity of Mr. Paine's motives. The wish of the
      philosopher is, let reason guide us, and all parties have freedom of
      debate. No dogmatical dictates of bigotted priests, no passive obedience
      to the mandates of inquisitors, nor to the persecutions so often fomented
      by churchmen. To the progress of letters, during this century, we owe the
      mildness and condescension of clergymen: till philosophy taught us, the
      clergy never discovered, that persecutions for heresy and witchcraft, or
      inquisitions and popery, were horrid institutions. Dares Dr. Watson
      affirm, that freedom of inquiry was ever suffered on religious subjects?
      that people were allowed to examine the grounds of the doctrines taught by
      the Church? No, Sir, your predecessors of all beliefs have ever persecuted
      philosophers and inquirers into truth, both in science and in religion.
      Neither Galileus nor Rousseau escaped the malevolence of the opposers of
      science; and in the Bible they found authorities for their inveterate
      opposition to the progress of truth and knowledge. The New Testament
      informs us, that the wisdom of God is foolishness to man, that human
      learning produces nothing but pride 1, and that the poor in spirit gain
      the kingdom of heaven.
    </p>

     1 "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain
     deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of
     the world, and not after Christ." Colos. ii. 5, 8.

     "Cum sit nobis divinis literis traditum cognitiones
     philosophorum stultas esse, ad ipsum re et argumentis
     docendum et; ne quit bouesto sapieutiæ nomine inductus, aut
     inanis eloquentiæ splendore deceptus, humanis malet quam
     divinis credere."

     Lactantius, Inst. lib. i. chap. 2.
</pre>
    <p>
      Under these and other similar pretences, have barbarous priests led their
      credulous followers to massacres in the name of their God; by means of
      that touchstone word, <i>Faith</i>, they made the multitude forget that
      their leaders were but men. Now, Sir, we have grown bolder: knowledge
      being no longer confined to clerical seminaries, priests are not kings.
      The church totters; and a single pamphlet, you say, "has unsettled the
      faith of thousands." Now, that you cannot stifle reason, you pretend to
      liberality of sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The natural historian, or the astronomer, fears not the publication of
      opinions contrary to his own, except from a scholastic habit, learned in
      the clerical seminaries, which still disgrace almost every country. The
      chemist eagerly peruses all theories; the divine alone refuses to argue
      with his opponents, and trembles at the very name of reason. I differ in
      my philosophical opinions from Mr. Paine; my principles extend so much
      farther than his, that I suspect I come under the class which you are
      pleased to call madmen, and every clergyman would affect to despise, but
      dare not argue with, before an unprejudiced tribunal. These, Sir, are the
      effects of superstition, and the cunning policy of the Church. The Bible
      is hardly suffered to be read in Catholic countries. The English reformers
      could not go so far; their revolution sprung from a dawn of philosophy.
      The English clergy, however, would confine us to the reading of that
      unintelligible farrago, and the still more insufferable commentaries upon
      it. So did the scholastics with Aristotle; their bigotted partiality to
      this author was nearly of the same force with the priestly attachment to
      the Bible. They retarded science; but the motives of the clergy are
      stronger. By the Bible they live; and it is not uncommon to hear the
      parson deride in private what he preaches from the pulpit.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to your first letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the pious wish for Thomas Paine's death, you proceed to state how
      miserable the adoption of his doctrines would render the "unhappy
      virtuous." Fear not such a dire event: the <i>pious</i> are few in number,
      and of those, few have the courage to open a book controverting their
      opinions, and which, they are taught to believe, contains nothing but
      blasphemies But, should chance lead them to a detection of their errors,
      they would only become less devout, and more useful citizens. Freed from
      the prospect of hell and heaven, they will have leisure to think of this
      world, in which they live somewhat like hermits, loving only their
      priests, and ready to sacrifice victims to credulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You say, that guillotine massacres were not the effect of the Popish
      religion, but of the disbelief of this system. This deserves some
      consideration. It is not true, that the majority of the people of Paris
      were unbelievers. No, Sir, they swore to the miracles of Abbe Paris, and
      were as ready to give testimony to the wonderful cures and prodigies
      operated by his intercession, as the Jews or Christians have been to vouch
      for theirs. The fact is this: the lively disposition of the French, the
      unintelligibility of their religion, and the shameful conduct of the
      priests, turned their attention to the more serious object of politics;
      but this event could not immediately change the nature of the murderers of
      the Protestants on St. Bartholomew's day. Does your Lordship imagine, that
      the peasants of La Vendee are models of morality? If you think so, I must
      undeceive you. Nothing but ignorance prevails in that district; like the
      ancient crusaders, they are led solely by their priests, who, by means of
      certain words which early habits and superstition have made their
      followers respect, and, together with want of communication with the rest
      of France, have inflamed them, and driven them to slaughter: even miracles
      have not been wanting in that part of the country; but in this, as in many
      other instances, they have disappeared, on the arrival of incredulous
      troops, whose hearts are perhaps hardened by God, like the Egyptians of
      old. Since God diminishes men's faith in proportion as he gives them human
      wisdom, let us not endeavour to controvert this heavenly will, by
      endeavouring to make the enlightened people of the eighteenth century so
      credulous as in the former days of ignorance. The Bishop allows, that the
      higher classes of every country all lean towards infidelity; they are more
      guided by reason, and reason is the avowed enemy of faith, it being the
      criterion of faith, that it contains natural impossibilities. It is
      unfortunate that so many sects pretend to faith, and differ so much among
      themselves; and that to explain their faiths, they use the weapons of
      reason against one another. This of itself proves, that faith is but a
      cant word, since the faithful argue about what comes not under human
      knowledge. Thus all religious sectaries, whether Christians, Jews,
      Mahometans, Boodzoists, or Bramins, as staunchly believe contradictory
      doctrines, while, in the inquiries that depend on their reason, we find
      that, wherever men have long been civilized, they have, in astronomy, in
      physics, or ethics, come in general to the same conclusions. The language
      of the philosopher is understood in Pekin as well as in Rome; but the
      religious fanatics of every country differ in their opinions, and consider
      all but themselves as dreamers and impostors. The Bramin laughs at the
      story of Noah and the ark, the stopping of the sun, and the incarnation of
      God; while the Christian shows the same contempt for the incarnation of
      Vishnu, and other articles of the Braminical faith. The exercise of reason
      alone shows us the true limits of our intellectual faculties. Ignorance of
      this is the cause of all reveries in science, as in religion; it is only
      superstition that incites men to launch beyond their conceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      You accuse of infidelity all those who commit crimes against society. When
      we answer, that the Jewish and Christian religions have deluged the world
      with blood, you reply, that it is not as being Jews and Christians, but
      because they were wicked. At the same time, I hope you allow, that the
      Spartans, the Athenians, the Romans, the Chinese, did not commit half the
      atrocities which disgrace Jewish history, the aera of the crusades and the
      Christian persecutions, of the invasion of America, the massacres of
      heretics, &amp;c. The candid observer must therefore conclude, that right
      and wrong is not confined to sects; that the Christian religion, whatever
      its precepts may be, has not been able to prevent crimes, while nations
      who knew not so much as the name of Moses or Christ, produced a Confucius,
      an Aristides, a Socrates, an Epaminondas, a Cincinnatus. Among these
      nations, who knew not the Lord Jehovah, we find Archimedes, Epicurus,
      Demosthenes, Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, while the chosen people of God, and
      their successors, the Christians, borrowed their language, the very names
      of their gods, and the little science they knew, from these despised
      infidels. It was not the oracle of Delphos, the augurs, or the sybils,
      that enlightened the Greeks and Romans. The rabble credited them, as the
      ignorant Jews and Christians did their prophets and apostles. In short,
      morals cannot be invented; there cannot be two systems of morality. The
      precepts must be directed to principles existing in the heart of man.
      Ignorance conceals from nations the rule of conduct, in the same manner
      that it prevents them from knowing geometry; the moment they study either,
      they are put in the road of truth. No wonder, then, that in the times of
      the greatest oppression, when frightened into certain doctrines by the
      stories of nurses and parents, many learned men should not have been able
      to conquer their first prejudices. You certainly know the time when
      astrology and the philosopher's stone were in fashion; the believers in
      these reveries were men of science. Van Helmont, Stahl, Boyle, and
      innumerable others were possessed of this madness. You can be no stranger
      to the numerous wretches that suffered for witchcraft and necromancy, and,
      upon the very brink of death, confessed they were guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next reflection the Doctor makes, is respecting gospel moderation, for
      which purpose he quotes, "Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?
      to his own master he standeth or falleth." Yet has this been done by all
      Christian rulers; and the clergy are at this moment, in express defiance
      of this maxim, about to send missionaries to disseminate principles that
      have ever produced internal dissensions, and without which infidels have
      lived in perfect happiness. It is, perhaps, an excess of piety; but cool
      observers pretend, that it is the high priest, not the High God, that they
      are going to preach: to fill their knapsacks is the first object of these
      pilgrims, and their God is made subservient. Unluckily for the Bishop, he
      could not adduce a more detestable maxim, to show his charity, than that
      which I have just quoted: it is the pivot of Oriental despotism; it
      teaches passive obedience to all classes; the father is the tyrant of his
      children, the nabob of his subjects, the emperor of all: it is a maxim
      whose tendency is to root in men's minds, that we are the property of one
      another, and may be inherited as cattle. To those of my readers who are
      pleased with it, I wish a thorough experience of its effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remainder of your first letter contains observations to which I
      perfectly accede. Your conclusion against Thomas Paine is perfectly fair.
      Any apparent deviation from moral justice in the world must prove as much
      against the goodness of God, as a similar inconsistency in his immediate
      actions and commands proves against revealed religion. My Lord, we are in
      the abyss of error; your question with Thomas Paine is about the
      comparative absurdity of the two Opinions. The deistical notions of your
      adversary do not agree with his reasonable tenets; but I readily grant,
      that, to a religious person, nothing is incredible; and that the greater
      the inconsistencies, the more sublime the system. But let me ask your
      Lordship, what you conclude against one, who, like myself, is not a Deist?
      and repeats, with the first philosopher of the age, that there are only
      four possible hypotheses upon the causes of the universe: 1st. That they
      are purely good. 2dly. That they are malicious. 3dly. That they are a
      mixture of good and evil. And, lastly, That they neither possess
      benevolence, nor any other passions. The two first hypotheses are equally
      contradicted by daily experience, the mixture of good and evil is too
      apparent: the third is denied, by the steadiness of the laws of nature:
      the last, then, only is admissible.
    </p>
    <p>
      You next proceed to justify several actions of the Jews, which you and the
      Bible are pleased to call God's commands. I must decline following your
      reasoning; for the very existence of such crimes as the Jews ascribe to
      their enemies, and which, they say, were so repugnant to God, would of
      themselves prove against the goodness of that Being. His frequent threats,
      and the extermination of so many miserable nations, is a poor expedient;
      like that of a man, who, attempting to make a machine, and foiled in his
      endeavours, gloried in breaking it in a thousand pieces. How much more
      ridiculous is that sublime Artificer, who employs the same means which
      impotence or malevolence give rise to in his wretched children. I am glad
      you have no recourse to the silly causes of atheism, as given by that
      illustrious dreamer, Plato.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world has too long been imposed upon by ridiculous attempts to vilify
      atheists, and show their nonexistence. That name has been a cant word,
      like Jacobin in France, and Whig and Tory in England, which every person
      applies to his neighbour as it best suits him. In Catholic countries, all
      who dare think are heretics; among Protestants, they are atheists. Being a
      word of opprobrium, it has ever been used as a powerful engine in the
      hands of the clergy. The question is upon the truth of systems, not upon
      the character of those who profess them. If this were the discrimination,
      and the palm given to that religion that has had the greatest number of
      honest men, the Christian system would certainly lose the contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bishop seems to think, that savages have not so perfect a notion of
      God as we imagine: religion, he supposes, begins as it were in express
      revelation. This is but the fancy of a clergyman, unsupported by any
      proofs; but at least it shows, that the Bishop involuntarily acknowledges,
      that reason alone can hardly give us the idea of a ruling Being. The
      savage, it is true, does not discourse in a metaphysical jargon; he wants
      expressions: but I wish the Doctor would inform me in what our Catechism
      definition of God is clearer than the notions of the rudest savage, who,
      trembling at the approach of thunder and violent convulsions of nature, or
      enjoying the genial sun and fertilizing inundations, imagines all the
      world to be animated with his own passions. The thunder is a mark of
      wrath, while the blessings are signs of a propitious genius. To conciliate
      these imaginary beings, to avert their wrath, is the grand object of
      superstition. Schoolmen conceal, under their mystical jargon, the real
      materials which their gods are made of; they conceal that the Supreme
      Artificer is the offspring of fancy, the figurative and unphilosophical
      symbol of nature, to which they give human dispositions: in all religious
      systems men are the type of their gods. Your letter concludes with a
      remark sufficiently extraordinary, that most Deists of your acquaintance
      disbelieve the mysterious conversations of God, his miracles, and such
      other stories, because they are too wonderful, and against the order of
      nature. Your reply is curious: because we never have seen the like of
      them, does it follow that they are untrue? Give me leave to tell you, my
      Lord, that you have forgotten the rules of logic: you know, that in all
      cases, but of demonstration, the philosopher does nothing but weigh
      probabilities. Any thing that is conceivable is possible: but are we
      therefore to believe in the existence of witches or necromancers? Are we
      to give credit to the world having sprung from an egg? That Mahomet
      divided the moon? That the sun stood still? That astrology is a science?
      Yet what reason have we to disbelieve them? The respective supporters of
      these opinions may say with the Doctor, that nothing can be too wonderful,
      and that, because these things have not happened in our time, it does not
      follow they should be untrue. I acknowledge, with the Doctor, that many
      Deists admit a Being as inconceivable as any religious mystery; therefore
      it may seem ridiculous in them to stop their credulity; since we call God
      just, when nothing but a concatenation of causes and effects can be
      perceived in the world; when we proclaim him benevolent, while the world
      is full of vice, while millions perish in misery, and continual calamities
      befal mankind; while, in short, most men have the gloomy prospect of
      damnation before them. These are greater miracles than an universal
      deluge, making a woman from a rib, or God's countenancing the atrocious
      murders of Jews. He that will believe one wonder, has no plea for doubting
      the rest.

    <h2>
      LETTER II.
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MY LORD,
    </h3>
    <p>
      Your second letter begins with some nice distinctions between authenticity
      and genuineness. The whole reasoning seems to amount to this, that a book
      may be authentic, although not genuine, and <i>vice versa</i>. To this
      proposition we were no strangers; but piety makes your Lordship forget
      some other considerations. When the proofs of authenticity depend in a
      great measure upon the genuineness of a book, then the authenticity falls
      to the ground the moment we prove it spurious. Thus the Jews strenuously
      maintained, that the Pentateuch had been written by an inspired man at a
      particular time. But if Moses is shown not to have written these books, I
      trust you will not declare them authentic, without other very solid
      proofs. When a whole nation is proved to be mistaken respecting the author
      of a work, we ought not hastily to credit their legends. Moreover, logic
      teaches us, that in proportion as events are incredible, they require a
      stronger testimony to prove that they have actually taken place. A battle
      may have been fought, a city may have been destroyed, but miracles being
      against the order of nature, no testimony can be strong enough to prove
      them, we must again appeal to faith. It is so much easier for men to be
      deceived or imposed upon, or for persons designedly to mislead their
      credulous followers, that unless it were more miraculous that a man should
      be mistaken, than that the miracle happened, we ought not to give credit
      to such fables. If we drop this rule of logic, we shall readily believe
      prodigies of all sorts, whether wrought by Moses, Jesus Christ, Mahomet,
      St. Antony of Padua, or any modern wonder-workers, witches, magicians,
      astrologers, or magnetisers. Mr. Paine no where asserts, that because a
      book is not genuine, it must be false; but certainly he might assert this
      of the Bible. You say, that if the works of Titus Livius had been ascribed
      to another, they would nevertheless be true; how would you ascertain it?
      If the whole Roman nation supposed them to have been written by a
      particular author at a certain time, and should we be enabled to point out
      many passages evidently written in a posterior age, would you, without any
      other proofs, join in the assent to the authenticity of the history, upon
      a tradition so vague, and already proved false in so material a point?
      Although I am no Bishop, I would only imagine, that as to probable events
      contained in such spurious books, there might have been some grounds for
      them; but I would receive them with great caution; and, at any rate, never
      would I establish a system of history, much less of religion, upon the
      productions of an ignorant people: in all cases, events related against
      the order of nature are to be considered as the reveries of dark ages. To
      elucidate your principles, you mention Anson's voyage, written by Robins,
      under the name of Walter, to prove that a spurious work may contain a true
      history; but, my Lord, do you forget, that this was written at a time when
      the whole nation knew that Lord Anson had made such a voyage, and every
      man in his fleet could testify the particulars of it? But if our
      posterity, four or five centuries hence, should discover a book purporting
      to be written by a Mr. Walters, detailing the voyage of Admiral Anson, and
      if in that book they should meet a passage speaking of the late revolution
      in France, or of the author's death and burial, would not that strike at
      the authenticity of the whole? Would any part be believed that was not
      corroborated by the evidence of respectable contemporary authors? All that
      could be inferred would be from the nature of the events related, such as
      the accurate description of countries, and such other particulars as
      marked either the period of the observations, or their truth: in the first
      case, they might suspect the work to be interpolated; in the second, they
      would value it only for the accuracy of information. It is different with
      scientifical and historical works: a spurious book of science may contain
      truths, they stand for themselves, they are the same at all times and
      places. Not so in history: the truth here depends on the universal consent
      of nations, on the testimony of authors of credibility confronted with
      each other, and in all cases relating things probable. When we read in a
      Chinese history, that the goddess Amida peopled the world by bearing male
      children from under one arm, and females under another, or, in the
      Mahometan writers, that the trees spoke to the founder of that sect, would
      a man credit any circumstance, however probable, related in such
      histories, without the strongest collateral proofs? And should we further
      discover, that these histories detailed events posterior to their author's
      death, would not this make the whole still more improbable? Your remark
      upon this subject is singular: you say, that if Joshua, Samuel, or Moses,
      declared themselves the authors of the works ascribed to them, then to
      prove these books spurious would at once destroy their genuineness and
      authenticity. I would reason thus: Moses does not say, that he was the
      author of the Pentateuch; why then do we believe that he wrote it? You
      would, no doubt, answer, that the tradition of the Jews proclaims him
      such. I retort, that if the genuineness of a book may be proved by
      tradition, we ought as much to argue against the authenticity of a work,
      from having proved the general belief of its genuineness to be founded on
      error, as if the author had said, I am the author of this book. This we
      shall, in the sequel, prove to be the case with the books of the Old
      Testament. The addition of an express declaration of Moses would add no
      authenticity to the Pentateuch, since it is as easy to forge a work where
      the author speaks in the first as in the third person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your next remark is concerning miracles. I have already observed, that no
      testimony can give them belief. You maintain, that the degree and kind of
      evidence for the prodigies recorded in the Bible exceeds that for any
      other wonders. How this happens I am unable to comprehend. I know they are
      contained in a book composed by the priests of the most credulous and
      ignorant nation that perhaps ever existed; and the authority of these
      unknown and obscure persons, is all the evidence we have for crediting
      their stories. An English Bishop tells his countrymen, that the miracle of
      the sun standing still is better supported than the prodigies of Abbe
      Paris, Mesmer, and the late Labre at Rome, than the numerous Indian,
      Chinese, and Popish miracles, of which a great part are attested by
      magistrates, divines, physicians, and the most enlightened classes of
      society; while the wonderful repast of the angels with Abraham, or the
      marvellous tale of Jonah's three days' residence in the belly of a fish,
      depends upon the authority of a book which we shall prove to be spurious,
      to have been lost for several ages, and to be compiled, if not altogether
      composed, by some Jewish scribes, who were, as they themselves
      acknowledge, the only men versed in the scriptures of the nation. I
      thought you would have known sacred history better than at the present day
      to make such unsupported assertions. Have you forgotten the wonders of the
      magicians of Pharaoh? Do you not recollect the express acknowledgment of
      Moses himself, that there may be miracles and prophecies performed by men
      who adored not the Lord Jehovah? Does he not say, in chap. xiii. of
      Deuteronomy, "If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
      and giveth thee a sign or a wonder, and the sign or the wonder come to
      pass whereof he spake unto thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, &amp;c.&mdash;that
      prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death, <i>because he
      hath spoken to you to turn away from the Lord your God</i>." It is not
      because he is a false prophet, but because he is not a prophet of Jehovah.
      Does not this at once show the grossness of the conceptions of the Jews,
      and the sophistical mode of arguing of their legislator? For I would ask,
      How did Moses prove himself the oracle of God? Or how did Jesus Christ
      show himself the Son of God, but by their pretended miracles? Why then
      believe the testimony of a miracle in one instance, and not in another?
      But the Jews certainly imagined, that there were several gods, and that
      they quarrelled with each other, as kings are used to do; therefore it was
      natural that one set of prophets should try to exterminate another, and be
      as inveterate against them as the Lord Jehovah was against Baal, or other
      rival gods. If the reader imagines I speak at random when I say, the Jews
      believed in other gods, I refer him to Judges, chap. xi. ver. 23, 34,
      where it is said, "So now the Lord God of Israel hath dispossessed the
      Amorites from before his people Israel, and shouldst thou not possess it?
      Wilt thou not possess that which <i>Chemosh thy god</i> giveth thee to
      possess? So whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us,
      them will we possess." There cannot be a fairer parallel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I can hardly imagine a Bishop ignorant of the augurs, oracles, and sybils
      of the Greeks and Romans, and of the implicit belief these nations had in
      them; the truth of their prophecies was fully as well established as the
      prophecies of the Jews. Neither were miracles uncommon among the heathens.
      You have, no doubt, read St. Ambrose and Origen, and have found in the
      works of these and other fathers, that the only difference between the
      miracles of the Christians and infidels, was, that the former were
      operated by God, and the latter by the devil; and could I be satisfied
      that Satan took up Jesus Christ to the top of that high mountain, (now
      unknown to geographers) from whose pinnacle all the world could be seen,
      this would surprise me as much as to see Jesus Christ, or any other
      wonder-worker, bringing a dead man to life. I am ashamed to have inveighed
      so long against silly prejudices; but I could not avoid calling upon your
      Lordship, to point out the difference between gospel-miracles and the
      ridiculous tales believed in all dark ages, and of which we find so
      copious collections in the works of the first fathers. The axiom of
      philosophers, that no human testimony can establish the credibility, of
      miracles, you have left unanswered. You say it has been confuted an
      hundred times: had you given the confutation of it, we would have been
      able to ascertain the truth of your assertion. You are writing for the
      multitude, and being a dignitary of the church, ought to furnish the
      people with arms to oppose reason. Perhaps the unsuccessful attempt of Dr.
      Campbell has deterred you from at least recapitulating the principal
      answers to this proposition. Till you can prove that the great mass of
      mankind are not very fallible and easily deceived by any impostor, or that
      they are disposed and capable to examine the truth of reports spread about
      prodigies, you will never be able to persuade men of sense, that events
      impossible are to be believed upon the testimony of those who not only
      are, but have constantly been, the slaves of credulity in all countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      You then show, that Mr. Paine's objections to the genuineness are not new.
      This is true; and I am surprised you have quoted so few supporters of his
      opinions. Your attempt to prove the genuineness of the Pentateuch, by
      direct evidence, is ridiculous. What! Maimonides, ten centuries after the
      destruction of the Jews, a Jew himself, and writing at a period so remote
      from the supposed date of the books of the Old Testament, is, by Dr.
      Watson, called a direct evidence of the genuineness of the Pentateuch.
      Juvenal, a poet, who in more than one place ridicules the credulity of the
      Jews, says, that they believe in Moses&mdash;so do the Europeans allow
      that the Indians believe in Brama.&mdash;We question not the general
      traditions of the Jews, but the credit they deserve; and I shall next
      proceed to show, that the books of the Pentateuch are spurious, and
      undeserving of credit. The name of Moses and the Jews were unknown to the
      famous Phoenician historian Sanchoniato, of whom Eusebius has preserved us
      some extracts; he has never mentioned a word about this famous legislator:
      had he done so, Eusebius was too strenuous an advocate <i>for</i>
      Christianity not to have recorded it. The books of the Jews were concealed
      from all the world before the famous Greek translation made at the
      instance of Ptolemy Philadelphia. Josephus himself acknowledges, that no
      heathen knew the Jewish books, which he endeavours to explain, by some
      miraculous interference of God to keep them from the impious. It is
      evident, that the insignificance and ignorance of the Jews were sufficient
      to screen them for a long time from the search of philosophers. Upon the
      early history of the Jewish nation, however, we have the testimony of
      several of the ancient writers. Manetho, and Chaeremon, Egyptian
      historians, give the most unfavourable account of this nation. Lisimachus
      does not favour them any more; and, although he differs about the name of
      the king who expelled them from Egypt, yet he agrees in calling them a set
      of men infected with leprosy, and the meanest of the subjects of the king
      of Egypt. Diodorus Siculus is as hard upon these wretched Jews. In short,
      the opinion of their being the vilest and most ignorant of men, has
      prevailed among all antiquity. All the writers about them agree in stating
      that they never produced any work in science; indeed, that they never
      improved any branch of useful knowledge. Many of these authors mention
      Moses as a priest of Heliopolis, who led them out of Egypt, and gave them
      a religion. Diodorus Siculus informs us, that the God of Moses was Jau, or
      Jahouh, which is the true pronunciation of Jehovah; and Plutarch (de
      Iside) says, that the Thebans adored this God, and had not images in their
      temples, because Jau signified the general principle of life, the soul of
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strabo, in his Geography, book 16, informs us, that Moses, who was an
      Egyptian priest, taught his followers to worship the God Jahouh, without
      representing it by emblems. This was the God of the Thebans, the soul of
      the world. The Jews have even preserved the name of Tsour, or giver of
      forms, and commonly translated by the word creator in chap. xxxii. of
      Deuteronomy. Herodotus affirms, that the Jews or Syrians of Palestine
      borrowed circumcision from the Egyptians. Diodorus says the same; and even
      Philo and Josephus do not deny it. A great many other rites were copied by
      the Jews from this nation. It is, therefore, of great consequence to
      ascertain the age in which the Jewish books were written; for if we can
      prove that all the fundamental points of their religion were copied from
      their masters the Egyptians, or borrowed from the Babylonians during the
      captivities, then the reader will judge of the truth of the clerical
      opinion, that a handful of hordes were the favourite people of God; that a
      set of ignorant and credulous vagabonds taught science to the Chinese,
      Indians, and Egyptians, and preserved nothing among themselves but some
      ridiculous accounts of their origin, and a collection of absurd prodigies.
      If we succeed in pointing out from what sources Jewish mythology is
      derived, there will be but little difficulty in unravelling the principal
      fables contained in the Pentateuch and other Jewish books. We are pretty
      well acquainted with the allegories of the heathen mythologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am ready to grant that several of Mr. Paine's objections are not valid,
      and often trifling; but I declare, once for all, that I do not think
      myself bound to follow Mr. Paine in every instance. I shall direct my
      remarks, rather to disprove your reasoning, than to defend every objection
      of your opponent; at the same time, I shall avoid repeating what he has
      advanced, and you have not disproved. The chief proofs against the
      genuineness of the Pentateuch have been overlooked by Mr. Paine. I shall
      state them briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      First. It was believed, by all the best informed old fathers of the
      church, that the Jewish books had been absolutely lost during the
      captivity, and that Esdras had written them from inspiration; or, that he
      collected the Pentateuch, and all other canonical books, out of whatever
      records he could find, and put them together. 1 In either case, their
      authority is greatly invalidated; and the more so, as the fourth book of
      Esdras, adopted by the Greek church, and generally deemed authentic, says
      expressly, that Esdras dictated the holy books during forty successive
      days and nights, to five scribes, who were continually writing. This tale
      shows sufficiently the general belief that he was the restorer of the long
      lost books of the law. In our second book of Nehemiah, or, properly
      speaking, Esdras, it is said, that Ezra, or Esdras the scribe, who was
      above all the people, brought the book of the law to the people, and then
      the people rejoiced much in being instructed in the law of God, that when
      they found there the commandment of the Lord ordering the Jews to perform
      the feast of the booths, there was great gladness, "and all the
      congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made
      booths, and sat under booths: for, since the days of Joshua the son of
      Nun, unto that day, had not the children of Israel done so.". If the Jews
      had even forgotten a feast, the memory of which every father would
      transmit to his son, is this not an evident proof that they had no books
      in the captivity? Again, in chap. vii. of the 1 book of Esdras, it is
      said, that Esdras "had very great skill, so that he omitted nothing of the
      law and commandments of the Lord, but taught all Israel the ordinances and
      judgments."
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     1 Porro Esdram sancti patres docent iostanratorem suisse
     sacrorum librorum, quod non ita intelligendum est, quasi
     scripturæ sacræ omnes perierint in eversione civitatis, et
     templi Nabuchodonosor, et ab Esdra divinitas inspirato
     reparatæ fuerint, ut fabulatur auctor, L, IV. Esdræ C. XIV.
     Sed quod Scripturas Mosis, et prophetarum in varia volimina
     descriptas, et in varia loca dispenreas, et tempore
     captivitatis non diligenter conservatas, Esdras summa
     diligentia collectas ordinaverit, et in unum quasi corpus
     redigerit. Bellarmin de Script. Ecclesiast. page 22.
</pre>
    <p>
      Can any man, after this, doubt that Esdras is the compiler of all the
      books which the Jews had not known for many centuries? And are we, who
      laugh at the Catholic councils, to trust to the word of a Jewish scribe?
      it is further stated in 2 Chronicles, chap. xxiv. ver. 15, that Hilkiah
      the priest found a book of the law of God <i>given</i> by Moses, and sent
      it by Saphan to king Josias, who heard it read, which shows that it must
      have been very short; and, by the context, it would appear to have been
      the law strictly speaking; another proof that these records were
      altogether scattered, and are all without authority, since it was so easy
      to forge them among a people who seemed to preserve no more than a
      traditional law. Again, although, in the older Jewish books, such as Kings
      and Chronicles, we find the name of Moses often mentioned, yet no word
      answering to the five books of Pentateuch is to be found. The Code of laws
      of Moses seems to have been forgotten; for Solomon ornamented the temple
      with calves, in express contempt of that law, and this while he was the
      favourite of God, and the wisest man in the world. The very confusion that
      pervades the books ascribed to Moses, shows them to have been
      compilations. Jerome, who was one of the most learned of the fathers,
      confesses that he dares not affirm that Moses is the author of the
      Pentateuch; he even adds, that he has no objection to allow that Esdras
      wrote the books in question. 1

</pre>
    <p>
      Secondly. We know that no canon of books ever existed among the Jew's till
      the time of the synagogue under the Maccabees. Before their reign, there
      had never existed among the Jews any such council; and, if the word occurs
      in the Pentateuch, it is a fault of the transcribers and composers, who
      lived when there was a synagogue, and is not to be understood in any other
      acceptation than a collection of priests. The Pharisees of the second
      temple chose the books they thought best among a multitude of forgeries.
      The Talmud relates, that this synagogue were about to reject the Book of
      Proverbs, Ezekiel's prophecies, and Ecclesiastes, because they imagined
      these writings contradictory to the law of God; but a certain Rabbin
      having undertaken to reconcile them, they were preserved as canonical. A
      prodigious number of forged Books of Daniel, Esdras, and of the Prophets,
      were then in circulation; and to distinguish the genuine from the false
      works became absolutely necessary. This doubt and uncertainty conspires to
      render the decision of the synagogue very doubtful; particularly, as we
      shall show in the sequel, that many passages of the Prophecies are written
      evidently about the time of this choice of sacred books, and inserted in
      them, probably by some cunning priest, as the oracles of Sybil were forged
      to suit Cæsar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirdly. The similarity of the mysteries of the Jews to those of the
      Babylonians, is too glaring not to let us see the origin of Genesis in
      particular. The creation in six days is a perfect copy of the Gahans, or
      Gahan-bars, of Zoroaster; the particulars of each day's work are literally
      the same. The serpent was famous among the Babylonians. The mythological
      deluge of Ogyges and Xissuthrus, are symbols of changes arising on earth,
      as they imagined, from the revolutions of the heavenly bodies. These, a
      little ornamented by the historical narration of Deucalion's inundation
      related by Berosus, is the pattern of Noah's flood; the ark of Osiris and
      emblematical dove and raven were Egyptian hieroglyphics. The man and the
      woman in Paradise is a mere copy of Zoroaster's first pair. The original
      sin is Pandora's box. The Talmud of Jerusalem says expressly that the Jews
      borrowed the names of the angels, and even of their months, from the
      Babylonians. The Elohim, or Gods, (not God), are said in Genesis to have
      created the world. It was not Jehovah, but the genii or gods that are in
      the Hebrew called makers of the world. And these are the very genii, who
      according to Sanchoniatho, were by Mercury excited against Saturn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fourthly. We ask, in what language was the Pentateuch written, if it
      really was the work of Moses? It is known that Hebrew is a dialect of the
      Phenician, and that the Jews spoke Egyptian for a very long time before
      they adopted the language of the people among whom they dwelt. In Psalm
      lxxxi. we learn that the Jews were surprised to hear the language of the
      people beyond the Bed Sea. If, therefore, Moses, or any person of that
      age, is the author of the Pentateuch, it is evident that the Hebrew books
      are mere translations. What degree of credit does a nation deserve, who
      have been able to take for originals books that were in the face of them
      translations? Is it right to persecute men, as priests have done while
      they had power, for refusing to give credit to this tissue of
      contradictory and absurd fables?
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifthly. In the books of the Old Testament, we find abundant proofs that
      they have been written in an age greatly posterior to that of Moses. In
      Genesis, chap. xii. ver. 6, we find these words, "And the Canaanite was
      then in land." This implies another period when the Canaanite was not in
      the land, which, we learn from the Bible, did not happen till after David,
      and could not therefore be written by Moses. The beginning of Deuteronomy
      is certainly not written by him; for he never passed the Jordan; he died
      upon Mount Nebo, to the eastward of it. The English translation has in
      chap. i. v. 5, of this book, said, "on this side of the Jordan," for "on
      that side," which is in the original. The translator has taken similar
      liberties very often. In chap. xxxiii. we find this expression, "There
      never was in Judea so great a prophet as Moses," and such could be pointed
      out in many places. Here needs no comment to show that such passages could
      only be written in a posterior age, and when there had been several
      prophets after Moses. Thomas Paine mentions many other passages, which I
      shall consider when I come to your next letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above considerations would be sufficient to invalidate the genuineness
      and authenticity of any historical book: but here we find that the
      credulity of bigots requires less proof for the authority of a work,
      which, according to them, is the fountain of faith, than for Ossian's
      poems, or any other book of no consequence. If a common historical work
      contains fables, impossible events, and anachronisms; if its age is not
      ascertained; if we are certain that it was unknown for many centuries; if
      we are even ignorant whether it is an original or a translation, who would
      give the slightest credit to such a book? Yet are enlightened nations led
      by the testimony of the Jews, a people credulous beyond measure, extremely
      ignorant, almost continually in slavery, and dispersed. This is the nation
      that pretends to give an account of the creation, and, with a vanity
      peculiar to an insignificant people, to assume the supremacy among
      nations, and arrogate to themselves the exclusive protection of Jehovah,
      and dare make their Adam the common stock of mankind. You allow, my Lord,
      that several passages have been interpolated in the Pentateuch. No person
      in the least acquainted with the history can deny that it has suffered
      great alterations; 1 and I have already noticed the opinion of the best
      informed fathers of the church upon the non-existence of the Pentateuch,
      several centuries prior to Esdras. I now beg to be informed, how we are to
      decide, if Hilkiah, in the reign of Josias, collected from tradition, or
      some old book he found in a chest, the precepts of the law? and whether
      the other famous scribe, Esdras, did not compile from hearsay, and some
      imperfect and scattered manuscripts of no authority, together with a great
      many Babylonish traditions, those venerable five books of Moses? We are
      informed, in one of the books that bears his name, that Esdras was the
      wisest of his cotemporaries, and therefore a very fit and probable person
      to write books out of old legends.

      If the books of the Old Testament were composed at so late a period, no
      wonder then that we find all the mysterious part of them so much like the
      religion of the ancients, and particularly of the Babylonians, and the
      historical part made up of heterogeneous matters, which in our days,
      unassisted by any profane writer of that age, we can make nothing of. I
      shall mention a few of the most striking points of resemblance between the
      Jewish and other mysteries. Abraham, the most famous of their patriarchs,
      has ever been celebrated in India. This they seem to have brought from
      their native country, Arabia. We have already noticed, that their account
      of the creation is exactly copied from Zoroaster, who says, that the world
      was made in six periods of time, called by him the thousands of God and of
      light, meaning the six summer months; in the first, God made the heavens;
      in the second, the waters; in the third, the earth; in the fourth, trees;
      in the fifth, animals; and in the sixth, man. The Etrurians and the
      Hindoos have very similar traditions of the highest antiquity, which,
      though they were emblems at first perfectly understood, astronomers
      afterwards converted them into periods, comprehending as many years as was
      required for different revolutions of the planetary system.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, while the Hindoos and Persians called the days or ages of the world,
      each of many thousands of years; the Jews, ignorant of astronomy, and fond
      of the marvellous, comprised all within six common days. Their firmament
      or heaven of crystal, and its windows, are absurdities not peculiar to
      them; the feast of the Pascha, which signifies passage, is of Egyptian
      origin, and was in reverence for the passage of the sun at the vernal
      equinox: the sacrifices of calves or oxen, the ceremony of the scape-goat,
      are Egyptian and Indian; the latter, in particular, have a ceremony
      altogether the same with that of the scapegoat. It is too long to insert
      here, but I refer my readers to Mr. Halhed's introduction to the code of
      Gentoo laws for information on this head. The distinction between pure and
      impure animals was first made by the Egyptians; the ladder seen in Jacob's
      vision, is exactly a copy of that with seven steps in the cave of Milthra,
      representing the seven spheres of the planets, by means of which souls
      ascended and descended. It is also the mythology of the Hindoos, whose
      antiquity no man at the present day can venture to deny. The seven
      candlesticks, and the twelve stones are Egyptian, and were emblems of the
      seven planets, and twelve signs of the Zodiac. The serpent is the most
      famous Egyptian hieroglyphic; it signifies eternity, or the sum of all
      things. The fasts before feasts are also derived from this nation. The
      Jewish high-priest, like the Egyptian, wore an image of sapphire, being
      the emblematic picture of truth, upon, his breast: in short, the
      Egyptians, their masters, gave them the first ideas of mysteries, which,
      in the course of time, they mingled with the Chaldaic; and Manetho informs
      us, in the extract given by Josephus in his first book against Appian,
      that, in authors of great authority, he found the Jews to have been
      distinguished in Egypt by the name of captive pastors, which Josephus
      artfully enough has attempted to convert into captive kings. These are the
      men whom sacred historians pretend to have taught the Egyptians all their
      arts. These wretches, despised of all nations, were themselves the
      emphatical admirers of the wisdom of the East. Their legislator was an
      Egyptian priest, and learned all that he knew from them; and you would
      persuade us that a set of Arabian hordes had founded the Egyptian empire,
      simply because they, like the Irish, are pleased to say that they were
      antedeluvians. I pardon the Jews for their credulity; but Europeans in the
      18th century ought not to think as the inhabitants of Palestine. If we
      give credit to all the reports of the origin of nations, we may give up
      all pretensions to common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The immortality of the soul is shown, by the learned but superstitious
      Warburton, never to have been mentioned in the Pentateuch; nor the notion
      of hell, or of future rewards and punishments. There is nothing more
      certain, however, than that the Pharisees, long before Christ, strenuously
      maintained the immortality of the soul, and in some measure adopted the
      doctrine of transmigration of souls, which they had got from the Greeks
      and other nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sadducees, founding themselves upon the Bible, fervently denied a
      future life. The Essenians, according to Philostratus, were Pythagoreans,
      both in their morals, belief, and mode of life, except that a few of the
      Jewish articles of faith, such as the necessity of circumcision, were
      mingled with their creed. Josephus himself acknowledges the similarity
      between the Essenians and the Plisti among the Thracians, to whom
      Zamolxis, the disciple of Pythagoras, taught his doctrines: The
      Therapeutes, the pattern and ori&mdash;gin of Christian morals, were
      reckoned amongst the Jews to be the most holy among the Essenians. They
      sacrificed their passions to God; they never swore, but made simple
      affirmations; they lived, as it were, in convents; they despised bodily
      pain: when they entered their state of perfection, they abandoned their
      property, wives, children, and all earthly concerns; they lived upon bread
      and water and salt; and spent the six days of the week in interpreting the
      allegorical sense of the Bible. They revered the Sabbath with a most
      scrupulous exactness; then they assembled in places set apart for
      religion, the men ranged on one side, and the women on the other,
      separated by a division four feet high, to prevent temptation. Then they
      sung praises to God, and preached; they obeyed all the laws of their
      country, but never would execute any order to hurt another person. They,
      like the Pythagoreans, thought themselves possessed of the gift of
      prophecy; they, like the Pythagoreans, believed in the great year, whence
      arose the famous millennium of the Christians. The three sects of Jews&mdash;Pharisees,
      Sadducees, and Essenians, lived all in perfect harmony; the incredulous
      Sadducees not being considered as heretics, but often attaining the
      dignity of high-priests. This suffices to show, that the Jews borrowed
      from other nations those very mysteries which the ignorance of writers has
      misled mankind to consider as the special revelations of Jesus Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have insisted so much upon this circumstance, because there is not a
      single article of Christian morals, nor one religious tenet, contained in
      the New Testament, that was not known before Jesus Christ was born. And
      the Christian religion, like that of the Jews, is a corruption of the
      mythologies of the nations they brand with the name of infidels.
    </p>
    <p>
      I return to your book. It is now needless to answer your logical
      inference, that if Esdras is the compiler of the books of the Pentateuch,
      they may still be true. I have already said, that we are not to sacrifice
      our reason to the compilations or works of a Jewish scribe, who borrowed
      evidently so much, and who pretended to divine inspiration and
      conversations with the angels. When I began to read your book, I was
      impressed with the idea of your candour; sorry am I to see the malevolence
      with which you treat Mr. Paine, and how much you misrepresent his just
      aspersions on the conduct of Moses. Your language almost persuades me that
      you do not differ from the gentlemen of your profession. Could Moses
      affirm, as you pretend he might, that he never persecuted any man? What!
      that monster, who, although married with a Midianite, ordered thousands of
      his credulous followers to be murdered, because one of them had slept with
      a Midianite, whom Josephus states was his wife! What! when his brother and
      coadjutor makes a golden calf to the people, this impostor, instead of
      punishing him, orders 3,000 men to be murdered, and appoints Aaron his
      successor! Because Korah, Da-than, and Abiram, could not suffer to see him
      usurping all the power, he murders them, although Korab was the descendant
      of Levi. This is Moses, who says, like Bishop Watson, that he "was a very
      meek man!" Were these continual murders necessary to instruct ignorant
      idolaters who followed the example of their priests? Have not the founders
      of our faith been the most cruel murderers? But all this we are told was
      the immediate orders of the Lord Jehovah, a merciful God. How feeble
      appears the power of this great God! He is continually repenting, and
      always obliged to renew his covenants with a set of wretches, who,
      although they enjoyed his special protection, always forsook him, and only
      fulfilled his commands strictly when they were ordered to massacre. They
      might have been the favourite people of God, but I am sure they were the
      disgrace of men. You talk of idolatrous nations sunk in vice. I know of
      none so barbarous as the Jews, whose legislator was obliged to fly from
      Egypt for murder, a perfect assassin. The laws concerning paternal power,
      which you support, are horrid. Their having been adopted by many nations,
      is a proof of the general prevalence of superstition, ignorance, and
      despotism. I have nothing to answer to your discourses on tythes. The
      Bible is preached up, because it teaches passive obedience, donations to
      the church, and such other acts of <i>public utility</i>.

    <h2>
      LETTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      After what I have observed above, it will be useless to say much as to
      your third letter, in which you examine minutely the passages Thomas Paine
      has pointed out to prove the Pentateuch not genuine. First, As to the
      objection taken from the name of Dan, I never thought it specious. This is
      not the case with the very next one, which is of very great weight. The
      writer, after enumerating a number of Arabian names, concludes in these
      words, "These are the kings that reigned in Edom, before there reigned any
      king over the children of Israel." Contrary to my expectations, you
      acknowledge this to have been written after the Jews had kings. Many of
      your brethren have attempted to deny it by quibbles! but you say that this
      does not invalidate the authority of the book: wonderful! if your <i>alma-mater</i>
      taught you, that an evident lie or contradiction in any book, particularly
      of remote antiquity, and relating histories unsupported by impartial
      authors, does not create a suspicion, which approaches to certainty, that
      the book is not authentic; if you think so, I must give up arguing with
      you. It may be an interpolation, you observe. How did you learn this? You
      will at least leave, me the right to suppose, and you cannot deny that the
      presumption is against you, an absurdity in a book is a reason for
      distrusting the rest. I have probability on my side; for the Jew who
      forged this passage, either from piety or ignorance, might have forged the
      whole book, or so interpolated it, as to destroy its credibility. At any
      rate, the detection of falsehood in a history, is not a motive to suppose
      it true. It requires an excess of piety to break through all the rules of
      logic and common sense. How does it happen, that the Lord Jahovah does not
      provide better against such mistakes creeping into the book of the law of
      his favourite people? It could seem as if he had done it on purpose to
      create incredulity, and enjoy the pleasure of punishing unbelievers, as of
      old, he hardened Pharaoh's heart, that he might have a pretext to inflict
      calamities on him and his people.
    </p>
    <p>
      My Lord, what credit would we give to a history of William the Conqueror
      that had the following sentence, after naming different persons, <i>And
      these were the names of the Kings of England before George the Third came
      to the throne</i>; for what purpose could any person insert such a
      passage? He must have been absolutely mad. It could only get into the work
      from its being compiled during the reign of George the Third, and arising
      from a forgetfulness of the writer, or ignorance of the transcriber: in no
      case could it be inserted in a book, which you say was kept in the public
      records, and over whose purity the whole Jewish learned men would watch;
      you must either give up your argument from the public records of this
      people, and no longer deem them great authority; or, if you persist in it,
      I leave you to reconcile the most palpable interpolations and forgeries
      with the scrupulous attention with which you suppose the Jews preserved
      the word of God. But what is most curious in this passage is, that we find
      it verbatim in 2 Chronicles, chap. i. ver. 43, and you seem to glory in
      discovering this similarity of the passages. "Why might not," you say at
      the end of your fourth letter, "the author of the book of Chronicles have
      taken them, (meaning the names of the kings of Edom, &amp;c.), as he has
      taken many other genealogies, supposing them to have been written in the
      book of Genesis by Samuel?" Another acknowledgment of more interpolations
      in Genesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, Sir, who gave you the right, you who exclaim so much against the
      unsupported assertions of Thomas Paine, to suppose that the author of
      Chronicles copied an interpolation from Genesis, knowing, as he must have
      done, that it was interpolated by Samuel?
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he not rather, to make the book consistent, expunge it? Could he be
      so ignorant as not to see the contradiction? What is more strange, how
      came Samuel to introduce such a passage? The tendency of it could only be
      to weaken the authority of Genesis; but, allowing all your groundless
      suppositions to be true, do you not see that they only prove the ignorance
      of Samuel and of the Jewish history writers, and at once destroy the
      superstructure you have in your following letters raised upon the supposed
      accurate records of the Jews? The supposition of Samuel being the author
      of the interpolation, is like an historian, who, to the history of Charles
      the First, should add some accounts, concluding with observing, that all
      this took place before George the Second, or should even venture further,
      and instruct us in some prominent features of the French revolution: yet
      this is the case with the passage in question; for it is unquestionable
      that the Jews had never a king till the time of Saul; that, under Moses
      and the Judges, they held kings in detestation. The fact is very plain. In
      Chronicles, the passage has an obvious and clear sense; for there an
      account of the kings of Israel is given, and the sentence now under
      consideration precedes it. Indeed, the whole chapter xxxvi. of Genesis is
      almost literally the same with chapter first of Chronicles; and every
      unbiassed man will conclude, that the former is copied from the latter.
      That little concluding expression, before <i>there reigned any king over
      Israel</i>, certainly marks its date; and there is nothing more probable,
      than that when Esdras and the scribes compiled these books, they should
      insert in Genesis the posterity of Esau, as far as the history of Genesis
      went, and that this unlucky passage should by mistake be copied too. I
      acknowledge, that an interpolation, when we can prove the period of its
      insertion, does not destroy the validity of a book, if the rest of the
      facts are consistent, and supported by collateral proofs; but the Bible is
      an unconnected rhapsody, written by we know not whom, without order,
      arrangement, or a shadow of method. Besides, it is the word of God; and
      what, in a profane writer, would be a slight error, is here a most
      material fault; if our future happiness depends, as you suppose, on our
      believing this book, which certainly can never take place while such
      reasons for scepticism remain. In proportion to the importance of an
      event, so we must be careful in examining the grounds upon which it
      stands, or else we must be like those whimsical men, who will require the
      best evidence for the truth of a trifling report, but find no repugnance
      in crediting the most marvellous events upon trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Paine properly concludes, that Genesis is a book of stories, fables,
      traditions, or invented absurdities, or downright lies; and this I not
      only affirm with him, but will prove to my readers, that it is in no
      respect deserving of more credit than the fabulous and early history of
      all nations. Next follows your rhapsody upon the beauty of the Bible and
      the truth of it. Pardon me if I think it like a madman's reveries. Even
      the men of your profession have long ago given up such a ridiculous
      conceit. Whoever has read eastern literature, or the late translation from
      the Shanscrit, will find that the same style with that of the Bible
      pervades all eastern compositions. In all of them we find the frequent use
      of allegory, and a quaint and formal manner of expression. Divest the
      Bible of its Oriental garb, and put it into common language, you will
      find, except the episode of Joseph, and two or three other passages, it is
      absolutely illegible. I have already shown the Pentateuch to have been a
      very modern work, and the Jews to have borrowed every thing from other
      nations. No wonder then that the <i>Abram</i> should resemble the <i>Brama</i>
      of the Hindoos, or that a few names in the supposed genealogies of the
      Jews should be like those of the Assyrians, Medes, &amp;c. Genesis gives a
      description of creation truly beautiful! We did not spring from
      grasshoppers, nor the world from an egg; but the wise Moses informs us,
      that we were made of clay and a little breath. This may be sublime to you;
      but the philosopher is never elated by fables so absurd. It is not true
      that Genesis is the oldest, nor a very old book. Sanchoniato, the Hindoo
      books, those of the Egyptians and Chinese, are of much higher antiquity
      than Moses. In vain has Mr. Maurice struggled to dazzle our understandings
      with his incoherent suppositions, to prove that the Hindoos borrowed their
      religion from the Jews, from a set of Arabian hordes, from the slaves of
      the Egyptians, from a petty nation, who, as Julian says, never produced a
      single work, and whose credulity has ever been proverbial. The
      astronomical records of the Chinese prove, that there were men and
      astronomers in that country at the time when the wretched Jews would make
      us believe the world was inundated from the windows of heaven, and no
      creatures existing but Noah, his family, and the beasts in the ark.
      Further, Souciet mentions an eclipse of the sun recorded in the Chinese
      history, which happened 2155 years before Christ, which is but 236 years
      after the Deluge; a time when, the Bible informs us, the earth was only
      inhabited by the sons of Noah, while Egypt was then so peopled, that
      90,000 cities could not contain the inhabitants, and China was not less
      so. The Hindoo astronomical observations, as far as they have been
      examined by the most learned astronomers of the age, such as Baillie, Le
      Gentil, and others, carry their antiquity between four and five thousands
      beyond our æra; for a proof of which, I refer you to Mr. Playfair's
      excellent paper, in the second volume of the Edinburgh Philosophical
      Transactions. The Hindoo religious books contain, besides, a great many of
      the ideas afterwards adopted by the Jews. The long lives of antedeluvians,
      in particular, are the exact copy of the Iogues of the Indians. The
      Dwapaar Iogue, the latter part of which answers to the period of Noah, was
      when men's lives were limited to a thousand years; and Methuselah we know
      did not live so long. They have, too, their mythological deluge, or the
      incarnation of Vishnu into a fish. For an account of which I refer my
      readers to Volney, and to Mr. Maurice himself. The former gentleman is a
      good judge of ancient literature; he pretends that he can prove, that most
      of the chapters of Genesis, supposed to contain names of persons, are
      mythological: the posterity of Noah is, according to Volney, no more than
      a geography of the world as known to the Jews. I have not read Mr.
      Volney's memoir which I understand he has published on this subject; but,
      when I consider the late period when Genesis and the other books were
      composed, and how much the Jews borrowed from the Egyptians and
      Babylonians, how much the deluge of Noah and his ark resemble the emblems
      of Osiris; in short, when I reflect on the unintelligibility and apparent
      absurdity of Genesis, on the impossibility of the Deluge, and of the not
      less absurdity of the population of the world so soon after that calamity,
      I confess I am much inclined to despise the whole performance. There have
      been various suppositions upon the meaning of the names mentioned in
      Genesis. Adam has been said to signify, in many parts of Asia, the first
      day of the week; and Enoch, the seventh successor of Adam, to be the same
      with Saturn, or the seventh day. Thus Assur, Elam, Lud, Madai, Javan, and
      Tiras, which are said to be the founders of the Assyrians, the Elamites,
      the Lydians, the Medes, the Ionians, and the Thracians, may very probably
      be nothing else than the enunciation of the names of these countries; for,
      between Assur and Assyria, or Lud and Lydia, there is not a very great
      difference. We know that Egypt is by the Arabs called <i>Masr</i>, which
      has the same consonants with the Hebrew <i>Misraim</i>, whose plural
      termination implies properly the inhabitants of Egypt. In the Bible, <i>Misraim</i>
      is called the founder of that kingdom. We also know, that Syria is called
      <i>Barr-el-sham</i>, or the country to the left. The inhabitants of
      Thebaid are called the sons of Cush. Again, we find several names of towns
      very much resembling those of the supposed founders of these monarchies;
      Sur, or Tyre, is not unlike Assur. These are conjectures; I pretend to
      found nothing upon them; but, at least, they are probable. Your Genesis,
      on the contrary, as it is commonly explained, contains palpable lies. It
      supposes a deluge, which neither did nor could take place; it destroys the
      human race, when we know that nations were then in existence. Lastly, it
      talks of the founders of nations, which existed long before that period.
      But, even had Genesis been written at the time of Moses, it might be worth
      while to inquire into the import of his genealogies; but, being a very
      modern compilation, collected by an ignorant people, partly from
      tradition, partly from scattered and mutilated records, it does not
      deserve the serious attention of the philosopher.

      You next attempt to justify the conduct of God towards the Canaanites,
      whose great crime was to defend their own country, and to adore their own
      gods instead of the God of the Jews. When a man makes an apology for such
      conduct, we only can answer by an appeal to the feelings of men, from
      which alone we derive notions of humanity. It was natural for the adorers
      of a Phenician Jehovah to be the enemies of the Babylonish Baal: both
      these gods sprang from the wild fancies of men. The jealous God of the
      Jews, the all-wise, omnipotent, and benevolent, could not convert the
      worshippers of another god, without exterminating whole nations, even to
      the little children; but this barbarous mandate came from the priests, who
      have in all countries, and all systems of Religion, adopted this method of
      conversion. You state, that Moses "gave an order that the boys and women
      should be put to death; but, that the young maidens should be kept alive
      for themselves;" and, that you "see nothing in the proceeding, but good
      policy combined with mercy. The young men might have become dangerous
      avengers of what they would esteem their country's wrongs; the mothers
      might have again allured the Israelites to the love of licentious
      pleasures, and the practice of idolatry, and brought another plague upon
      the congregation; but the young maidens, not being polluted by the
      flagitious habits of their mothers, not likely to create disturbance by
      rebellion, were kept alive:" and you add, that "the women children were
      not reserved for the purposes of debauchery, but of slavery; a custom (you
      acknowledge) abhorrent from our manners, but every where practised in
      former times, and still preserved in countries where the benignity of the
      Christian religion has not softened the ferocity of human nature." Is
      extermination an example of the mercy of priests and their gods, "whose
      justice is subservient to mercy," "whose punishments originate in his
      abhorrence to sin,"&mdash;and whose commands to massacre, to butcher, and
      to exterminate, "are only benevolent warnings?"&mdash;You dare Mr. Paine
      to prove, that the young women were kept for debauchery; and you
      triumphantly add, "that if he does, you will allow Moses to be the horrid
      monster he describes him, and the Bible a book of lies, wickedness, and
      blasphemy." Do you think, that consigning to slavery thirty-two thousand
      maids, is consistent with the benignity of God? I do not hesitate to
      consider this worse than merely making them the partners of licentious
      pleasures. But, in what consisted the wonted wisdom of a God, whom you
      describe as ever solicitous to lessen the influence of sin? Let me ask
      you, if the young women were not as liable to incite the passions of the
      Jews as their mothers, and whether their slavery would not increase the
      opportunities for debauchery? Could it be consistent with humanity, much
      less with the mercy of an all powerful God, to put to death all the boys
      of a nation, merely because they might in time revenge the insolent
      invaders of their country? Were all the male children already polluted
      from their birth? It would have been easy for them to convert them to
      another religion, but to your God it was impossible. The bloody invaders
      of America pursued not another plan, even after "the benignity of the
      Christian religion softened the ferocity of human nature." Have these
      Christian invaders any where respected the chastity of women when they
      made them slaves? And have the Jews, God's chosen nation, at any period,
      either while under his protection, or since he abandoned them, shown
      themselves more virtuously inclined than other people; were they ever
      prevented by the striking manifestations of his mercy, his power, and his
      justice, from going away to adore other gods, and falling into all sorts
      of wickedness? In short, if the Bishop rests his defence of Moses and the
      Bible upon this passage, I am willing to appeal to the judgement of all
      mankind. If any person can believe it consistent with the benevolence of
      omnipotence, to sacrifice whole nations to be massacred and plundered by a
      few hordes of bloody Jews; if he can think this to be part of a grand
      scheme for the good of mankind, he must give up all pretensions to reason,
      common sense, and humanity. But it is time the world should see, that this
      holy book the Bible, "which, in weight of authority, and extent of
      utility, exceeds all the libraries of the philosophers," contains
      pretences for all bad actions, and stifles the laws of humanity and
      morality. Upon this book have inquisitors, crusaders, and religious men,
      founded pretences for the most diabolical persecutions, avowedly
      undertaken for the express purpose of unrooting infidelity, and for the
      glory of the Lord. Every man who reads the word of God is warranted to
      reason thus: God has ordered murder and robbery; he has instigated his
      favourite people to exterminate whole nations; therefore I can do no
      better than to imitate the Almighty; and every crusader may pretend to
      have the same authority from God as Moses; and miracles are never wanting
      to prove it. Because Abraham was a pimp, and his wife a prostitute, so may
      any person be, without losing the patronage of the God of Abraham. Every
      man, in short, may imitate the meek Moses, the humane David, without
      fearing to incur the displeasure of the Almighty. Thus Ravaillac thought
      he was doing as holy a deed, when he attempted the life of Henry; as
      Dominic, or Torquemada, when butchering the wretched heretics, who had the
      misfortune to fall a prey to their bloody zeal. The whole Old Testament is
      so filled with barbarous stories, that if they did not excite laughter by
      their improbability, they would freeze the blood in, the veins of any man
      endowed with humanity. What an irksome task have those undertaken, who
      have attempted to reconcile the horrible crimes of the Jews with the mercy
      and wisdom of the Creator? Has ferocity forsaken Christians as you
      insinuate? Have the modern religious fanatics yielded in cruelty to the
      Jews? Those two religions have successively inundated the earth with the
      blood of innocent victims. Have not the followers of Christ constantly
      preached passive obedience to the church, have they not frequently
      relieved the people of their oaths, and have they not fomented most of the
      civil wars that laid waste all Europe? It is well that priests have not
      been able to persuade mankind of late, that the minister was the oracle of
      God. The pride and foolishness of science has put this out of their power;
      they cannot lead nations as they did the Jews; we are not so easily
      persuaded of the immediate manifestations of God's commands to the priest.
      We know science too well to believe that the pillar of fire that went
      before the Israelites was God himself. We might have shown the people,
      that a pan with red-hot substances would have the appearance of a fire by
      night, and a cloud of smoke by day, a custom practised, from time
      immemorial, by the caravans. Although, my Lord, the wisdom of God may be
      foolishness to man, I acknowledge I am neither fond of crediting
      absurdities, nor have I so much faith as to take the work of priests for
      supernatural mandates of Providence; when they speak in their usual
      senseless and unintelligible language, I conclude that it is either to
      dazzle the ignorant multitude, or I look upon their dreams as the
      consequence of dire superstition, the first effect of which is to make us
      unacquainted with ourselves, under the imposing aspect of familiarising us
      with imaginary beings. At the conclusion of my remarks upon the Old
      Testament, I shall give a few extracts from those books, wherein my
      readers may see the character of the Jews and their God in glaring
      colours, and judge whether any honest man would not tremble at the
      thoughts of having done as much injustice, and committed such atrocities
      as this Jehovah.

    <h2>
      LETTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      You enter again upon your favourite topic, genuineness and authenticity. I
      shall not repeat what I have already said. I confess my great surprise at
      your laying such stress upon the most trifling and false of your
      arguments. You now strive to prove, that a book may contain a true
      history, although it should be anonymous. Pray, my Lord, do you think,
      that to prove a book spurious, when it is believed to be genuine, is a
      demonstration of the truth of the contents? You thus leave us uncertain
      whether Joshua be a genuine book. You have sadly confused yourself in the
      maze you have created. To put it beyond a doubt that the sun stood still,
      you appeal to the book of Jasher, which Joshua mentions in the following
      words, "Is not this written in the book of Jasher?" And in like manner,
      you refer to other books frequently quoted as authorities in the Bible.
      Does your zeal blind you so far as not to let you perceive, that this very
      argument may with redoubled strength be retorted against you? for if an
      author, who is said to write his own history, appeals to another book for
      a proof of his actions, that book must be of much greater authority than
      his own: we cannot avoid believing the writer of the work alluded to had
      better information. In short, the book appealed to contains the only
      authentic testimony. Now, permit me to ask you, who could be better
      authority than Joshua himself, writing at a time when we must suppose many
      of his soldiers who had witnessed the miracle were alive? What is this
      anterior book which Joshua respects so much? Was it written by himself,
      then it would be idle to quote it; and, at any rate, whoever had written
      it, it is evident that the author of the book of Joshua has no proofs of
      his own, but rests solely upon the book of the Holy, or of Jasher. This
      circumstance proves clearly, that the writer of the Book of Joshua
      composed his book out of some more ancient memoirs, which being lost, we
      can say no more of their authority than for that of any old tales. You
      talk of the public records of the Jews as confidently as a Member of
      Parliament speaks of the papers in the Tower. Do you know at what period
      the Jews began to keep written records, and do you also know, whether
      those that were kept existed when the books of the Old Testament were
      compiled? Had you been instructed in these particulars, and had you been
      not altogether divested of candour, you might have informed your readers,
      that, previous to the time of kings, we have not a shadow of proof of the
      existence of any historical records among the Jews. We, no doubt, read,
      that there was a book of the law of Moses, in which Joshua wrote something
      too respecting the renewal of a covenant. This seems to be the only
      written record among the Jews, and it contained nothing but religious
      precepts, or the law, strictly speaking. In Joshua, chap. viii. ver. 31,
      we read, "As Moses the servant of the Lord commanded the children of
      Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses and ver. 32, He
      wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote in
      the presence of the children of Israel and ver. 35, He read all the words
      of the law, the blessings, and curses, according to all that is written in
      the book of the law of the Lord, and there was not a word of all that
      Moses commanded which Joshua read not before the congregation of Israel."
      We know, likewise, that this law was written in the circumference of an
      altar composed of twelve stones. This is the only book either Moses or
      Joshua were ever said to have written; the writers of the Pentateuch, and
      of the other books, certainly never meant to inscribe them to Moses,
      Joshua, &amp;c.; they bore the names of books of Moses, of Joshua, Judges,
      &amp;c. because they treated of these personages. What then do you infer
      from the quotation of books by the Bible authors, except that they all
      wrote in very modern times, when they wanted the corroboration of more
      ancient books, whose date and authority we are equally strangers to? This
      book of the law, which you so triumphantly mention as a book written and
      existing a few years after Moses, turns out to be nothing more than what
      is contained in Exodus, chap. xx. to chap. xxiv. to which Joshua added
      some detail about the third covenant of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      I beg the reader will observe, that the writer of the Book of Joshua does
      not mention the second, third, or any other book of Moses, but simply
      notices the book of the law of God. Now this great book was written upon
      twelve stones, and in Exodus we find the precise commandment of Moses to
      build the altar, and to read the commandments at the feast of tabernacles;
      so that it contained not one line of history, and could have no authority.
      It was a law written upon stones, which Moses, in Exod. chap. xxiv. v. 7,
      is said to have read to the people: "And he took the book of the covenant,
      and read it in the audience of the people." This covenant, and
      particularly the repetition of it after the disobedience of the Jews, is
      the only part of the Scriptures that Moses ordered to be preserved with a
      religious care. Nothing of the most important parts of Genesis or the
      other five books is ever mentioned in the commandments of the law of God:
      the writer of the law certainly knew not that the Pentateuch existed. Had
      Moses written such a work, would he have failed to recommend to the
      Levites to keep the precious records of mankind, the sublime account of
      the creation? Did not the whole of the faith of the Jews depend on their
      being acquainted with the history of their forefathers, who were under the
      immediate protection of God? The ten commandments every person knows from
      the light of nature; no nation has ever mistaken them; but the origin of
      mankind is a subject of great darkness, and which the Jews ought to have
      preserved most carefully. Certain, however, it is, that excepting a few
      rites, the Jews lost not only their books, but even the recollection of
      their feasts, during their captivity. The other books referred to in the
      Bible prove, that those left are mere collections of borrowed stories, and
      pretended abridgements of books of greater authority, which are
      unfortunately lost, and leave a wide field for scepticism, particularly
      upon improbable or contradictory accounts. As to the belief that the books
      of the Old Testament are inspired, it is a tale, which, after what we have
      stated, even a child would laugh at.
    </p>
    <p>
      You next seriously endeavour to corroborate the ridiculous miracle of the
      sun and moon standing still. You are as unsuccessful in historical as in
      scientifical arguments. The story in question is so stupid, that the bare
      mention of it marks a man's credulity, so as to render him the object of
      compassion. That an ignorant fanatic should attempt to defend such
      absurdities, would be a matter of no surprise; but to witness a Regius
      Professor of Divinity, a natural philosopher, bring forward facts from
      profane history to prove the truth of so bare-faced a lie, denotes at
      least your want of prudence. I cannot persuade myself that you seriously
      believed what you wrote; I cannot think you capable of falling at once
      into the most gross astronomical and historical error. I shall state the
      matter briefly. There was a tradition in all antiquity, and particularly
      among the Egyptians, relating to that motion of the earth's axis which has
      been observed by astronomers, and whose complete revolution round the four
      cardinal points takes up no less than 9,160,000 years. In the course of
      this revolution, it necessarily happens, that the sun will rise where it
      sets, that north will be south, and so on. The Egyptian priests pretended
      that this revolution had taken place in their country without changing the
      climate, while the Babylonians maintained, in the time of Alexander, that
      140,000 years had elapsed since their first astronomical observations.
      This, no doubt, was the time that must have elapsed since the earth moved
      north and south. The Egyptian priests, long before Herodotus, had lost
      their knowledge of astronomy, which accounts for their mistake. It is
      evident, that the displacement of the earth's axis must be accompanied by
      the heaviest gravitating matter, and, therefore, what is now land, has
      been and will, in the course of ages, become sea. Now, my Lord, what has
      the Egyptian tradition to do with the sun stopped by the robber Joshua?
      What connection has the stoppage of the sun, or rather the earth's motion,
      with the sun rising where it sets? Were the thing possible, the sun would
      nevertheless rise in the east. Besides, does Joshua say the sun changed
      its course? Had this been the case, (I am ashamed even of the
      supposition), how could the earth change its axis in an hour, without
      shattering the whole globe, without inundating vast tracts of country, and
      tearing others asunder to reestablish the equilibrium of gravity? Study
      and consider; do not attempt to ridicule the little learning of Thomas
      Paine, when you fall into such absurdities. Read Chinese history, and you
      will find that their careful astronomers did not perceive the long day and
      night. It was probably the sun of Judea only that altered its course; they
      did not seem to be enlightened by the same luminary. Those who believed
      that heaven was made of crystal, could find no difficulty in crediting
      this silly story. I have insisted so much upon this, because you ought to
      know the common principles of astronomy, and somewhat of history. Here
      again you appeal to the book of Jasher: it deserves no more consideration.
      To deem an appeal to a lost book evidence of a prodigy, because the author
      affirms it, is a degree of credulity which may gain the kingdom of heaven;
      but, in the republic of letters, such believer will pass for a very
      contemptible reasoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the miracles, and the histories, better attested than the
      History of the Twelve Knights Of Charles the Great, and such other foolish
      tales. Surely, none can believe that 19,000 men fought against the
      Midianites, and murdered a prodigious number, without having lost a man,
      and disbelieve the famous battles of the knights, in many of which six men
      fought several thousands; the conversation of the devil with Cromwell, or
      the miraculous appearance of God to almost all the knights and warriors
      among the Catholics. The sacred phial of Rheims, and the chapel of
      Loretto, were both conveyed in a manner you know well, and which few men
      in the two countries dare controvert. They too appeal to their books of
      Jasher. The tale of making the sun stand still has not even the merit of
      novelty; this luminary had long before stopt his career, out of respect to
      Bacchus. Neither is the shower of hail-stones new, for Jupiter of old sent
      a shower of hail upon the rebellious sons of Neptune.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Joshua having written the book that goes under his name, we have,
      besides what has been stated, the strongest evidence against the
      genuineness of this performance. The death of Joshua is recorded in chap.
      xxiv. and it is related exactly in the same style as what precedes it. The
      writer even mentions several events posterior to the death of the son of
      Nun. You have passed over the arguments of Thomas Paine drawn from this
      passage, "The Jebusites dwelt with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto
      this day." It was natural for you to overlook a passage, which
      demonstrates that the book of Joshua was not written until after David,
      when, and not before, the conquest of the Jebusites took place. It is
      beyond a doubt, that they never dwelt with the Jews in the time of Joshua,
      since, in the first part of the above quoted passage, he says, "As for the
      Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children of Judah could not
      drive them out." How then did the Jews inhabit Jerusalem in the days of
      Joshua? I refer the reader to the Age of Reason, and to an answer to it by
      Mr. David Wilson, for further information, on this head. In the latter, he
      will be amazed at the weak subterfuges used by the author to evade the
      strength of the objection by Mr. Paine. But this is not the only event
      related in Joshua, which did not take place till some time after his
      death. Almost the whole of chap. xvii. contains facts of this nature.
      Where the portion of Manasseh is described, it is said, in ver. 12, "Yet
      the children of Manasseh could not drive out the inhabitants of those
      cities, but the inhabitants would dwell in that land." It is added, "And
      it came to pass, when the children of Israel waxed strong, that they put
      the Canaanites to tribute; but did not utterly drive them out." Now this
      certainly did not take place during the life of Joshua, for in the very
      same chapter, he promises those of the tribe of Manasseh success against
      the Canaanites. In the preceding chapter, v. 10, there is a passage of the
      same kind, "And they (the Ephraimites) drove not out the Canaanites that
      dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt among the Ephraimites unto this
      day, and some under tribute." This needs no comment: let any person ask
      himself when this came to pass, and they will at once find out the credit
      due to books containing such shameful anachronisms and falsehoods. In
      chapter first of Judges, purporting to contain the history of the Jews
      after Joshua, the reader will find a faithful copy of the passages quoted,
      not excepting the taking of Jerusalem. Let himc ompare ver. 8, 27, 28, 29,
      and following, with the detail of distribution of lots to the tribes, in
      chap. xvi. and xvii. of Joshua the same events are told in the very words,
      and apply to two different periods. This is a strong instance of the
      disorder that pervades the whole of these books, and how undeserving of
      credit, even in the most probable events, is what you call sacred writ. We
      are constantly reading over accounts of the same events, sometimes said to
      be written by dead men, and never marking time; for <i>it came to pass</i>,
      which is the Bible phrase, does not fix the period when the event took
      place. These books bear all the marks of being the productions of some
      persons at a very late period, and to have suffered great interpolations.
      Joshua is, in the face of it, a continuation of Deuteronomy, Judges of
      Joshua, and so on through the remainder.
    </p>
    <p>
      You pass on to Judges. It requires neither great knowledge nor ingenuity
      to discover, that this book is an unconnected farrago put together by some
      unknown person. You do not attempt to say any thing in its favour. Sad
      falling off from the paths of faith! Formerly it would have been a heresy
      to assert that Judges was a book of no authority: now, even a Bishop has
      nothing to say in its defence. You then proceed to Ruth, and endeavour to
      blot out the apparent infamy of her conduct, with what success, I leave
      the reader to judge, after he has perused her history. Next follow your
      subtle distinctions between the inspired and non-inspired part of the
      Bible, which may be very intelligible to an inspired Bishop, but cannot
      fail to appear a mere dream to a man in his senses. Notwithstanding Austin
      and your other brethren, this distinction rests upon nothing but fancy.
      Your request is very moderate. "Receive the Bible," you say, "as composed
      by upright and well-informed, though in some points, fallible men, (for I
      exclude all fallibility <i>when they profess to deliver</i> the word of
      God), and you must receive it as a book revealed to you in many parts by
      the express will of God, and, in other parts, relating to you the ordinary
      history of the times." Bravo! A Catholic is as reasonable in his demands.
      He only asks a little credulity to believe the inspired when <i>they
      profess to be so</i>. It is truly a childish request, begging the question
      at every word. To believe the Bible to be inspired is the grand point. The
      reasoning you employ is in perfect consonance with the absurdity of your
      wishes. You disbelieve a history if you find it inconsistent, but revere
      it, and swear by the author, if he wrote by inspiration. Swedenburgh could
      not wish more faith in his adherents. You say <i>receive it</i>, as the
      inquisitors said <i>imprimatur</i>; but philosophers weigh the ground of
      their belief; they detect the Bible writers, prophets, and inspired men,
      in palpable contradictions in history; and you will obstinately insist on
      our believing the most improbable of all their stories, because their
      absurdity persuades the faithful that they were revealed by their God in
      dreams.&mdash;&mdash;You have acknowledged yourself, in a subsequent
      letter, that the history and mystery of the Bible are so interwoven, that
      if one falls the other cannot be maintained. Why did God mingle his
      important and sublime precepts with such ridiculous trash, so as to induce
      mankind to disbelieve them both? Suppose I should meet a peasant coming
      from a fair, pretending he had seen the king with his guards, and if I
      should find this to be untrue, would I not deserve to be laughed at, if I
      credited that he had wrestled with a spirit, or that he was carried up to
      heaven? This, however, is the case with the Bible. Here we are told that
      the sun stood Still to protract the bloodshed of that villain Joshua,
      while, in another place, we read that a city was taken 370 years before
      that event. Your vaunted prophets were soothsayers, psalmists, and
      orators, who were generally employed in writing the public records. It is
      a word applied in the Bible to holy men. These prophets, like the augurs
      of the heathen, were often detected in falsehoods, and, in the time of
      Samuel, it would appear, by the Bible itself, that to raise ghosts was a
      trade as common as that of tailors in our days.
    </p>
    <p>
      You now come to Samuel. You are candid enough to acknowledge with Hartley,
      that he could not have been the author of the second book, nor of most of
      the first that go under his name, yet this has been the opinion of the
      church; and I know of no direct proofs that he wrote the remainder: by
      what logic do you or Hartley conclude, that Samuel wrote any part of the
      books ascribed to him? An author is proved not to have written most part
      of a work ascribed to him, who then would, without direct proofs, proclaim
      him the writer of some small passage, or any particular part of the work?
      Who but a clergyman would build a system upon a mutilated, spurious, and
      insignificant collection of absurdities and wonders? It is, I allow,
      probable that Samuel wrote something: your quotations prove no more; but
      what this was, we are, I presume, equally unacquainted with. That the
      scribes also composed some records of the lives of their kings, I will not
      deny. The question is, what degree of credit does the mutilated,
      contradictory, and fabulous collection, said to be made out of these
      records, deserve?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the time of Charles the Great, some persons probably recorded his
      actions. Is this a reason for any man to believe the fabulous legends we
      have of him, written in the dark centuries? The legends of the Egyptian
      and Greek gods, and their collection of oracles, were not only credited by
      whole nations, but proclaimed true by councils much wiser than the
      synagogue. The records of the saints were undoubtedly made few years after
      their death, in ages far more enlightened, after the invention of the
      press, written by the then most learned men of society, (the monks), who
      certainly were not inferior to the Jewish scribes, yet these legends
      contain often nothing but collections of absurdities and miracles. Read
      the <i>Flores Sanctorum</i> of the Romish church, and you there will find
      miracles in every page, and the lives of saints a tissue of prodigies. I
      need not add, that very few learned men among the Papists give credit to
      the absurdities contained in these books. It is even the opinion of the
      best informed men, that the monks have written lives of saints who never
      existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      You acknowledge the wickedness of the kings of Israel and Judah; but you
      take care to observe, that this was not owing to their religion.
      Impertinent assertion! Was not Saul dethroned because he was humane enough
      not to cut Agag in pieces? Did not the Lord Jehovah love the man after his
      own heart, who put the miserable inhabitants of Rabah under saws, axes,
      and arrows of iron; who made them pass through the brick-kiln? Did not
      this Jehovah approve the base murder of Adonias? Was it the same Jehovah
      who said to Jonah, that he was not so unjust as to sacrifice the whole
      city of Nineveh for their sins, because there were thousands in it who did
      not know between good and evil; and who yet, the Jews tell us, commanded
      the extermination of whole nations, without even sparing the little
      children? Did not the plagues which he sent to Pharaoh and David fall upon
      thousands of innocent individuals? At least, do not the Jewish books
      affirm it? Such horrors could only be respected by the Jews; such absurd
      miracles could only be credited by the most ignorant of men. You pretend,
      that the partiality of God to the Jews proceeded from their being the only
      nation that believed in the unity of God, and who have preserved their
      belief on this head unshaken till the present day. Are you in earnest, can
      you assert this before men of common information? Do you take Englishmen
      for idiots to be deceived by your assertions? Are you ignorant of the
      adoration of the Ethiopians? Do you forget that the wise men among the
      heathens said, <i>Colitur forma pro Jove?</i> Did you never peruse any
      account, of the Chinese, or of the Hindoos? Do they not admit one supreme
      agent, an all-wise, intelligent, &amp;c. being, and whose inferior agents
      they represent by symbols? The Hindoos have even all the metaphysical
      refinement of our divines; and their definition of God is fully as
      perspicuous as that given in our Catechism. I have avoided to give long
      extracts in this pamphlet; but, that the authority of an English Bishop
      may not be a presumption to many that I am making false assertions, I
      shall transcribe a passage from a commentary upon the Reig Beid, a book
      unquestionably of the remotest antiquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glory be to Goneish! that which is exempt from all desires of the senses,
      the same is the mighty Lord. He is simple, and than him there is nothing
      greater. Brehm, (the spirit of God), is absorbed in self-contemplation;
      the same is the mighty Lord who is present in every part of space. Brehm
      is one, and to him there is no second; such is truly Brehm. His
      omniscience is self-inspired, and its comprehension includes all possible
      species," &amp;c. It is true, we are not here told that God is a jealous
      God, that he visiteth the iniquities of the father even unto the fourth
      generation. I could adduce fifty passages from the Greeks and others to
      prove my position, but it is needless. The point is still to know whether
      these notions make men better, whether they are founded on truth, and,
      indeed, whether all gods are not the work of the fancy of man, nature
      allegorised. <i>Primus in orbe Deos fecit timor</i>, says the philosopher;
      can you disprove it? I suspect not, and that all the subtle reasoning of
      divines destroy themselves. The world is the ultimate of human reason. We
      adore the idols either of our hands or of the brain, and mistake them for
      existences. The region of chimeras exists beyond the universe; our
      prattling upon it is but a play of words. Jehovah himself, when he said, I
      am that I am, called himself pretty plainly Pan, or the great whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if the unity of God be the only gracious belief in the eyes of the
      Creator, I do not see that Christians are entitled to his favour, because
      they make him three. What was the belief of the Jews? Had they any very
      refined ideas of their God? They thought him corporeal, incessantly
      speaking and moving among men, jealous, revengeful, powerful, whose angels
      ate with Abraham, who himself strove to kill Moses in a public house; they
      imagined him repenting of his deeds; and, in all respects, a poor
      contemptible being, the offspring of Jewish fancy. He is throughout the
      Bible an Asiatic Sultan, who, like the merciful God of Mahomet, puts to
      the sword, and smites with plagues thousands, as a tribute to his infinite
      mercy. I refer the reader to the collection of extracts from the Bible, in
      a subsequent letter, for proofs of my assertions. The Jews admitted,
      besides other gods, such as Chemosh, several beings subordinate to God,
      but superior to man, as the serpent which tempted the mother of mankind.
      They had exterminating angels and cherubims, the Elohim or Genii that made
      the world, &amp;c. But why dwell upon such topics, when it is evident that
      all the Jewish mythology is of Chaldean origin, and our theology a copy of
      that of Plato?
    </p>
    <p>
      You proceed in your attempt to reconcile the justice of God with his
      goodness, and, in the height of your reverie, you imagine that the
      sufferings of the Jews were parts of a grand scheme for the general good
      of mankind. What, and when are we to see the good effects of their
      barbarities? We may see reason counteracting the evil of superstition,
      rendering men humane; but I apprehend, that, if your reasoning was
      generally adopted, every highwayman would be much inclined to think
      himself sent by Providence for good and wise purposes, and if chance
      should bring about a happy event at the end of his career, which he
      thought the consequence of his deeds, he would triumph in his crimes, and,
      like Moor in the Robbers, exclaim, "If for ten I have destroyed, you make
      but one man blest, my soul may yet be saved!" This has been the language
      of persecutors. They destroy mankind to make them happy in the next world&mdash;tortures,
      burning, and beheading, are but purifications. The worst is, that the
      famous divine scheme of general good, has never been one jot more advanced
      than when the Jews were enduring the greatest calamities, and committing
      atrocities. I count not the effects of reason, for faith is alone the
      godly faculty; reason destroys it. I close my observations upon this
      subject with repeating the old question of Epicurus, which your brethren
      have as yet left unanswered; either God can prevent evil and does not
      choose it, or he chooses it and wants power to avert calamities from his
      creatures. In the first instance, he is a malevolent despot, a character
      we ought to abhor; in the second, we see him an impotent and secondary
      being, which raises our contempt. Reconcile this with his infinite power,
      wisdom, and goodness, and show us that he is not formed after the image of
      man, or else let unbelievers hold their opinions in peace.

    <h2>
      LETTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Your fifth letter begins with stating the importance of the concession of
      Thomas Paine, that the books of Ezra and Nehemiah are genuine. You
      triumph, and think it a silent acknowledgment of the reality of the
      prophecies mentioned in those books. Stop, my Lord, your <i>alma-mater</i>
      surely has not taught you to draw such conclusions. In a genuine book
      there may be contained incredible events, as in Tacitus, Suetonius, and
      almost all existent histories. It is your duty to prove that the
      prophecies there related are not among those popular stories which are apt
      to gain general credit, whether they are or are not forgeries written
      after the events. Before we know when Jeremiah wrote, and what is the
      meaning of the writings under his name, no man is warranted to triumph at
      the testimony of the Jews after the captivity; since it is a point, in
      which all parties agree; that their canon and books were compiled at that
      period, and nobody ever questioned the credulity of the Jews. You proceed
      to state your notions of the history of the Old Testament; it is all a
      matter of opinion; and, as you do not support it by any proofs, we must
      still continue to regard the contradictions and impostures contained in
      the Old Testament as proofs of its having been the work of ignorant
      fanatics. I pass over your effusions: that metaphysical disquisitions
      teach us the limits of our faculties, I strenuously maintain; and if you
      mean nothing else, we are agreed. That our notions of time and place are
      not the bugbears which the scholastics would persuade us, is to me
      unquestionable; that both in science and religion we affix no ideas to
      many words, I grant; that certainty in philosophical disquisitions is not
      easily found, I also allow; but, that a man tired with the arduous task of
      reasoning, of discerning between truth and falsehood, should seek in
      polemics or superstition a consolation for his ignorance, I consider as a
      proof of the impaired state of his faculties; he is like the thirsty
      traveller, who, burnt by the scorching sun, seeks to relieve his distress
      by drinking of the first water he meets, without regarding its purity.
      Your acknowledgment that it is possible even for a Bishop to err in
      matters of religion, gives me real pleasure. To consider our creed as a
      matter that admits of doubt, is a great step in the road of truth. You
      say, "May God forgive him that is in an error." Your wish is humane; but,
      if God be the Creator of mankind, he cannot be offended at the conclusions
      we may draw, after having employed the faculties he has given us. I wish
      too that mankind should forgive them that are in an error; but, I hope,
      they will recollect the long sway of superstition, and its danger to
      mankind; may they decide in favour of that system which is conformable to
      reason, and has the greatest tendency to improve society!
    </p>
    <p>
      You next proceed to show the propriety of the angel ordering Moses to pull
      off his shoes, which you say is a mark of reverence to God. Is it then by
      such ridiculous customs that you reconcile your omnipotent and all-wise
      God? Too long have men substituted rites for morality. O superstition!
      that makes the Asiatics eat the excrements of the lama, the Papists devour
      their God; that persuades all Christians that water washeth away sin; and,
      that if a child happens to die before his face is sprinkled, he must
      inevitably suffer everlasting torments: led by this, men despise society,
      and tremble at ceremonies invented by their priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      I shall not go at great length into the particular contradictions which
      are found in the enumeration of the families that returned from Babylon.
      There certainly are great mistakes in the sums; and where precision was to
      be expected more than in any thing preserved in the record of the people
      of God, we find them committing the most gross errors, even when they
      attempt to be peculiarly exact. It is curious, that the individual sums
      are altogether different in the different accounts, and, therefore, that
      there must have been a much greater number of errors than you would
      persuade your readers.
    </p>
    <p>
      You come to the book of Job; and confine your remarks to disprove the
      objection of Mr. Paine, drawn from the name Satan, which, he says, is
      there for the first and only time mentioned in the Bible. Your answer,
      that it is repeatedly to be found elsewhere in the Old Testament, is just
      but it certainly does not prove Job to be a Jewish book. We know that <i>Sathan</i>,
      as well as the names of all the angels, are Chaldean; and as I have
      already shown, that the Scriptures are compilations written after the
      captivity, it is not wonderful that this name, together with many others,
      should be found in the Hebrew Bible. As you say nothing in favour of the
      book of Job, I shall only observe, that it is not only the opinion of
      Abenezra, but even of Jerome, the author of the Vulgate, that it is not a
      Hebrew book, the idiom being in many instances altogether different from
      the style of that language, and very frequently bearing marks of its
      Arabic and Syriac origin, as the reader may see in his preface to Job in
      the Vulgate edition of the Bible. The resemblance between Job's Satan and
      Momus is so striking, that we cannot help recognising the author to have
      been a Gentile; and thus are the Jews deprived of a book, which, at least,
      contains no murders, and shows more knowledge than that nation ever
      possessed. Your remark as to the generality of the belief of a benevolent
      and a malevolent being, certainly does not prove that the Gentiles
      borrowed this notion from the Jews; you ought to have known history
      better, and that the wars of the Gods and angels formed part of the creed
      of many nations, not only before a book of the Bible existed, but even
      before the birth of Moses. Dionysius and Osiris had already fought against
      the evil genii: the famous Vishnu has been from the highest antiquity the
      enemy of Chiven. That the numerous mythological systems which have ever
      existed, sprang from the report of the fathers of the Jewish nation, may
      appear probable to a clergyman; it is but a pious whim; to me it is a
      proof, that all religious systems have sprung from the fancy of men. The
      philosophers among the heathens understood by the evil and bad genii
      nothing more than the influence of the good or bad seasons, which,
      personified by ignorant or cunning priests, have by the vulgar been deemed
      real personages. Besides, where do you find in the Pentateuch any accounts
      of the Devil? I only see the serpent, an emblem I have already said,
      copied from the Egyptians, but by the Jews considered a real snake, which
      talked and walked upright. It was but a poor imitation of the Ahrimanes of
      Zoroaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concerning the utility of prayers, and the tendency of those of the Jews,
      I shall say nothing. It is a certain fact, that Solomon, the wisest of
      men, and who made excellent prayers, killed his brother; while many of
      those heathen tribes, abhorred by the Jews, had no other crime than to
      adore images; and, if superstition among them sometimes produced the
      abominable practice of human sacrifices, they never carried their piety so
      far as to exterminate whole nations. Besides, the Jews had not even a
      pretence to despise their neighbours for offering human sacrifices. The
      case of Jephtha shows plainly that this barbarity was common among God's
      people. I am utterly surprised at your misplaced exclamations upon the
      morality of the heathens. Far be it from me to stand forward as the patron
      of heathenish superstition; it is the mother of ours, and I abhor the
      common stock; but, my Lord, you ought not to confound the rites of the
      Greeks with their morals. The Athenians possessed virtues which we in vain
      look for among the despicable Jews. They possessed knowledge, and their
      philosophers had more sense than to believe the tales of the priests.
      Epicurus taught peaceably, and was revered by all, while the vulgar of his
      country firmly believed their mythology. Such an instance never happened
      among the Jews. Jehovah would quickly have sent a plague among Epicurus
      and his followers, or ordered his priests "to kill every one his neighbour
      and his friend, and hang them up before the sun." Your holy brethren would
      think nothing of a burning match on the occasion; if it were in your
      power, atheists would not exist long. But you talk so confidently of the
      adoration of images among the Gentiles, that we would imagine the Jews
      were all philosophers. Do you forget their reverence to the holy of
      holies, which none could approach; the ark of the covenant, and the
      calves? Or has the story of the five golden mice, for looking at which
      fifty thousand and three score and ten Israelites were smote by the Lord,
      escaped you?
    </p>
    <p>
      Your rhapsody upon the sublimity of Bible composition, and its superiority
      to all profane writers, is a proof of the strength of early imbibed
      prejudice. I lament to see a man of your learning think so much like an
      old woman. The proverbs, to be sure, are wonderful compositions, and prove
      the great gift of wisdom bestowed by God upon Solomon! What indeed can be
      more sublime than the following, which I beg leave to add to the specimens
      given by your Lordship! "The horse leech hath two daughters, crying, Give,
      give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea four things say
      not it is enough; the grave, and the barren womb, the earth that is not
      filled with water, and the fire that saith not it is enough."&mdash;"There
      be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea four which I know not;
      the way of an eagle in the air, the way of a serpent upon the rock, the
      way of a ship in the midst of the sea, and the way of a man with a maid."&mdash;"There
      be three things which go well, a greyhound, an he-goat also, and a king."&mdash;"It
      is the glory of God to conceal a thing, but the honour of kings is to
      search out a matter."&mdash;"When thou sittest to eat with a ruler,
      consider diligently what is before thee, and put a knife to thy throat if
      thou be a man given to appetite."&mdash;"Buy the truth, and sell it not."&mdash;"A
      whore is a deep ditch, and a strange woman is a narrow pit."&mdash;Excellent
      Solomon! Hear also this wise king in Song of Songs. "How beautiful are thy
      feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! The joints of thy thighs are like
      jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman; thy-navel is like a
      round goblet which wanteth not liquor; thy belly is like a heap of wheat
      set about with lilies; thy two breasts are like two young roes that are
      twins; thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fish pools in
      Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim; thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon,
      which looketh towards Damascus." Whether this alludes to one of Solomon's
      concubines, or our mother, the church of Jesus Christ, the expressions are
      equally applicable, beautiful, and simple; they are worthy of a man "wiser
      than Ethan the Ezrehite, and Heman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of
      Mehol," who, I dare say, were wise men. Upon the whole, I agree with you,
      that Solomon, the illustrious offspring of the man after God's own heart
      and the virtuous Bathsheba, was not "a witty jester." As to what you call
      his "sins and debaucheries," these holy books were certainly not written
      with a view to make us avoid them. Solomon is set before us as a pattern
      of wisdom and goodness; and the number of his wives and concubines is
      exultingly recorded as a proof of his greatness, as much as his treasures,
      which exceed all conception, and the number of his horses, which exceed
      all belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your pious belief in the inspired prophecies of Isaiah, is natural to a
      superstitious and credulous mind. The philosopher who doubts before he
      gazes, sees in what you call prophecies nothing else but scraps of history
      or legend. He receives with diffidence all predictions. He is aware of the
      great ease with which forgeries may be passed among the vulgar for
      prophecies. When pretended predictions are made, they are altogether
      overlooked; even the ignorant think not of them till they are said to be
      accomplished; the learned despise them in both instances; and it is not
      till after their authenticity has gained a sort of general belief, that
      the philosopher thinks of enquiring when and how they were made. At this
      period he can find no evidence of their history, but from the credulous
      who have been imposed upon by them. Besides, no prophecy is ever direct,
      it always has an equivocal meaning, and is explained to suit the events
      which have happened. Religious enthusiasts write in such a mystic language
      upon the sins of mankind, and the judgements that are to come upon them,
      and in so general and ambiguous terms, that it is easy for a subtle
      interpreter, or a visionary fanatic, to explain them according to his own
      system. Have not the bears of the Apocalypse been made to signify by
      turns, the Pope and the Devil? Has not the New Jerusalem been sometimes
      taken for a real flying town, seen in the air by the first fathers of the
      church, as Tertullean informs us? Do not other divines tell us that it
      means the kingdom of heaven? Have not scripture divines, even in the first
      ages of the church, pretended that the verses of Virgil, <i>Jam redit et
      Virgo, redeunt Sa-tumia regna, jam nova progenies ccelo demittitur alto;&mdash;natte
      mets vires, mea magna potentia solus, and talia perstabat memorans,
      fixusque manebat</i>, were clear prophecies of the Virgin Mary, and Jesus
      Christ? It might be worth enquiring at this time, whether the Roman Bard
      was inspired by the Holy Ghost? Lastly, I may ask, does your Lordship
      believe in the many prophecies that have of late appeared of the French
      revolution?
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have more reasons to declare the pretended clear prophecies of the
      Bible to be fables. In many instances they are so accurate, and so unlike
      these passages which we know to have been written previous to the events
      to which they are applied, or those which are not yet fulfilled, that no
      philosopher can pronounce them to have been written historically. Thus, we
      find Jacob announce to his twelve sons, the heads of the twelve tribes of
      Israel, the fate of their posterity; the situation of the district to be
      occupied by the Israelites in the land of Canaan, two hundred years before
      Joshua parcelled out this land in lots to the Israelites; the kind of life
      the different tribes would lead; the small number of the posterity of
      Reuben, Simeon, and Levi, as well as the power of Judah; all which are
      related as exactly as if the patriarch had seen the throne of David and
      Solomon with his own eyes. Some of the supposed predictions of Isaiah and
      Daniel, are even more minutely correct. You have treated the question of
      the genuineness and date of works very lightly; you think it is of no
      great consequence to ascertain the genuineness of the different books of
      the Bible. Let us for a moment suppose, that by some accident, the age of
      Virgil had been forgotten, or the sixth book of his Æneid been ascribed to
      a writer of the age of Æneas; would not the Romans be entitled to regard,
      as a most wonderful prophecy, the lively representation given by Anchises
      of the future heroes of the republic, the two Cæsars, and the young
      Marcellus?
    </p>
    <p>
      To resume our subject: I remind you of the passage already quoted from
      Bellarminus, that it was the opinion of the fathers of the church, that
      the Prophets, among other books, had been collected and arranged by
      Esdras. I have also stated the selection of genuine works by the
      synagogue, during the reign of the Maccabees, when the Talmud says that
      the forgeries of Daniel, Esdras, &amp;c. were prodigious. The destruction
      by Antiochus Epiphanus of the already broken Jewish books, written by
      Esdras, may be collected from what is said in Maccabees, chap. i. ver. 56
      and 57. "And when they had rent in pieces the books of the law which they
      found, they burnt them with fire, and whosoever was found with any of the
      books of the Testament, or if any consented to the law, the king's
      commandment was, that they should put him to death."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is without reason that you triumph at the application which Thomas
      Paine makes of the prophecy of Isaiah, in chapters xliv. and xlv. No man
      that reads the passage can hesitate for a moment to declare it a narrative
      of the deliverance of the Jews by Cyrus, after the seventy years
      captivity. Cyrus is mentioned by name, as well as his command to rebuild
      Jerusalem, and his victories over the nations, above one hundred years
      before the event. Will you then, without any proofs of Isaiah having
      written this book, insist upon calling it a prophecy? And have not
      sceptics been justified in their disbelief of the genuineness of such
      books? Mr. Paine, however, has overlooked a more remarkable prophecy in
      this book, which has been tortured into an application to Christ. This is
      contained in chapter lxiii. ver. 1. "Who is this that cometh from Edom,
      with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel,
      travelling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in.
      righteousness, mighty to save." And again, in chap. ii. (talking of the
      supposed Christ) Isaiah says, "And he shall judge among the nations, and
      shall rebuke many people; and they shall beat their swords into
      plough-shares."&mdash;"And the idols he shall totally abolish." Can this
      possibly allude to Christ? Did he come from Edom in mighty power, in rich
      garments? Was his march so terrible? Was he the man who trampled all in
      his fury; who with his own arm brought salvation to himself, and was
      upheld by his fury; as also mentioned in chap. lxiii.? Do not these
      pretended prophecies also apply to Judas Maccabeus, who delivered the Jews
      from the tyranny of Antiochus Epi-phanus? And is it not also a proof of
      the mutilated state of the works of the prophets to see details about
      Cyrus intermingled with others applying to Judas Maccabeus? I say nothing
      of Daniel, for his <i>prophecy</i> I shall consider particularly
      afterwards, and show its true meaning; at present, it may be sufficient to
      say, that the similarity between the book of Ezra and Daniel proclaim them
      to be from the same hand; but both have evident marks of having been
      considerably mutilated. When philosophers cannot ascertain the age of
      pretended predictions, they consider their clearness as a demonstration of
      their being histories. Who tells you that the books which the synagogue,
      like the Nicene council, chose, were not either altogether written, or
      considerably interpolated, to adopt them to the times? The great question
      is always, what authority had the synagogue to decide, and whether their
      decision ought to influence men of sense, any more than the determination
      of the Popish councils.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a proof of the absurdity of the application of prophecies, I shall here
      quote one, which is apparently clearer than any in the whole Bible, and is
      adduced by the most famous divines as an unquestionable prediction of
      Christ. It is in Micah, chap. v. ver. I. "Now gather thyself in troops, O
      daughter of troops: he hath laid siege against us; they shall smite the
      Judge of Israel with a rod upon the cheek. But thou Bethlehem Ephratah,
      though thou be little among thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he
      come forth unto me, that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have
      been from of old, from everlasting." Here even the birth-place of Christ
      is mentioned, the insults offered to him, his existence from everlasting,
      and his coming to save Israel. And Matthew, chap. ii. ver. 6, and John,
      chap. vii. ver. 43, both expressly refer to that passage as a prophecy.
      Hear now what follows in ver. 5, of the same chapter of Micah: "And this
      man shall be the peace, when the Assyrians shall come into our land: and
      when he shall tread in our palaces, then shall we raise against him seven
      shepherds, and eight principal men." Can this apply to Jesus Christ? Were
      the Syrians in the land when he came? Were not the Romans masters of
      Judea? Your rules of belief are admirable: a little faith, wherever you
      meet contradictions, absurdities, or wonders, is an invaluable
      prescription, common to the Bramin, the Musselman, and the Christian. Do
      but believe that Mahomet is a prophet, that he went up to heaven and saw
      the eternal Father, and you will go through the other articles of the
      Mahometan faith without difficulty. Do but admit the gospel of Barnabas
      where Mahomet is predicted, and we have no reason to say that it is less
      authentic than our gospel, and the work is done; but, I may say with you,
      "Proof, proof is what I require, and not assertion."
    </p>
    <p>
      We will not relinquish our reason in obedience to the despotic mandates of
      the credulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      You allow that the miracles of the Jews fall to the ground, if the history
      of that nation is proved false. I beg you to observe, that if it is true,
      it does not follow that the miracles are. If you can believe that the
      history of the Jews is well authenticated, and without numerous
      contradictions, and if you can exculpate the writers from bad motives, and
      a desire to deceive, and if you can rely upon their wisdom, you then will
      really prove yourself a Christian, a man of uncommon faith. The history of
      the Jews, every where confused, containing prodigies, deserves no more
      credit than their antedeluvian tale. Even Chinese history, supported by
      astronomical observations, is beyond a certain period rejected by all men,
      from the fables it contains. If you are disposed to believe, I advise you
      to read the fabulous history of China and of Hindostan, in the holy books
      of the respective nations, which are adopted by whole nations, and are, at
      least, more beautiful than the Jews.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have purposely omitted to speak of Ecclesiastes. I find here several
      Epicurean notions, a disbelief of a future life, the propriety of enjoying
      themselves in this life, and other sensible remarks; which prove that the
      writer enjoyed more common sense than most of his countrymen.

    <h2>
      LETTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      You begin your sixth letter by attempting to disprove the arguments of
      Thomas Paine upon Jeremiah. You acknowledge the disorder that prevails in
      the writings of this prophet; and you modestly assure us, that you do not
      know the cause; no more do I: and whatever incidents might have occasioned
      it, I am certain that, as it stands, it deserves no degree of credit. In a
      former part of your pamphlet you grant, that the history of the Jews is so
      connected with the prophetical part, that if the former was done away the
      latter could not stand; and now you inform us, "that prophecy differs from
      history, in not being subject to an accurate observance of time and
      order." This you think a matter of no importance, but, in my opinion, it
      is very material to know if a prophecy is written after the events it
      alludes to. I shall not follow far, either your Lordship or Mr. Paine, in
      proving several of the prophecies of the Bible false; but if they are not
      prophecies, why should we trouble ourselves with disproving them. If they
      are scraps of history, we know that of the Jews to be so contradictory,
      imperfect, so completely without order, that one historical extract, of
      prophecy, will often contradict another; but much more generally these
      prophecies are strict enough, being copied from history, and embellished
      with a little of the figurative style of prophecy. As to Jeremiah, the
      works that go under his name, as well as those of Isaiah, appear on the
      face of them to be a collection of extracts from different historians.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we know so little of the history and genuineness of these writings,
      we cannot possibly draw any conclusion concerning them, except that they
      are in the utmost disorder, and that when writers intermingle history with
      prophecy, we are at a loss to know which is which. I cannot forbear to
      mention the ludicrous story of Elisha, the children, the bears that
      devoured the children of men, as you are pleased to call them. Whether
      Elisha did this as a prophet, I cannot but declare my abhorrence at your
      approbation of such abominable cruelty, to murder individuals because they
      bestowed the appellation of Baldhead on another. According to the laudable
      custom of the church, you appeal to a miracle, and conclude, that if God
      wrought a miracle it must have been just. I suppose this comparatively as
      when he destroys whole cities for the sins of a few; but this is the very
      ground on which every crusader supported his massacres; and every man may
      imitate the conduct of Ahod, the treacherous murderer, patronised by
      Jehovah, without incurring the blame of a Bishop. Whether the ridiculous
      tale which you take for a sign of God, most probably of his cruelty,
      converted any person, is not known; but as the event most undoubtedly
      never happened, you may suppose what you please. To murder them is not the
      way to ingratiate ourselves with our fellow-citizens. If any person set a
      few bull-dogs on some children, and pretended to do so by authority from
      heaven, he would most undoubtedly be taken up by our officers of justice.
      In what respect do these brutal prophets differ from Mahomet, who decided
      all disputes by the sword? Their business was to exterminate and murder by
      the direct commands of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writings of Ezekiel are considerably truncated. The very beginning of
      his prophecies shows it. The conjunction and texture of the whole work
      refers to something that ought to have preceded it. He begins saying,
      "That in the 30th year the heavens opened, and he saw visions of God." And
      in ver. 5, he adds, "That the Lord had inspired him often in Chaldea,"
      which refers to some prophecies written in that period. Besides,
      Josephus's work, book 10, chap. ix. of the Jewish antiquities, says, "That
      Ezekiel had prophecied that Zedekiah should never see Babylon." This is no
      where found in Ezekiel, but, on the contrary, in chap. xi. and xii. he
      says, "That the king would be carried a prisoner to Babylon."
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Daniel, I have already noticed the great similarity between the
      first book of Esdras and his, and the probability that they came from the
      same author. The seven first chapters, except the first, were written in
      Chaldean, and are by the most learned thought to be taken from Chaldean
      chronologists. It is also thought by men of great learning, that the books
      of Esdras, Daniel, and Esther, were altered a long time after Judas
      Maccabeus, because it appears evident that Esdras could not have written
      the whole of them, since Nehemiah carries the genealogy of Jesuhga, the
      sovereign Pontiff till Jaddua, the sixteenth in number, who after the
      defeat of Darius went to meet Alexander. And Nehemiah, ver. 22, "The
      Levites, in the days of Eliashib, Joiadah, and Johanan, and Jaddua, were
      recorded chief of the fathers; also the priests, to the reign of Darius
      the Persian." We have no reason to believe that Esdras or Nehemiah could
      survive fourteen kings of Persia, Cyrus having been the first who gave the
      Jews permission to rebuild the temple, from whom to Darius there are 230
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now come to the famous prophecy of the seventy weeks of Daniel, which
      you exultingly mention as the most wonderful, and, at the same time, the
      most incontrovertible prediction in existence, one which never can fail to
      confound the most perverse unbeliever. If I prove, that so far from being
      the surprising prophecy you pretend, it has altogether a different
      meaning, and can nowise apply to the coming of Christ, I shall think
      myself fully excused, if I do not go through every individual prediction
      in the Bible. The passage alluded to is in Daniel, chap. ix. ver. 24, to
      27, as follows: "Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people, and upon
      thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,
      and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting
      righteousness, and to seal up the vision, and prophecy, and to anoint the
      most holy. Know, therefore, and understand, that from the going forth of
      the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah, the
      prince, there shall be seven weeks; and threescore and two weeks the
      streets shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times. And
      after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for
      himself; and the people of the prince that shall come, shall destroy the
      city, and the sanctuary, and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and
      unto the end of the war desolations are determined. And he shall confirm
      the covenant with many, for one week; and, in the midst of the week, he
      shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease; and for the overspreading
      of abominations, he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation,
      and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate."
    </p>
    <p>
      This passage is generally applied to the coming of Christ. The seventy
      weeks are supposed to mean weeks of years, or seven years each. Now it is
      evident, that it cannot apply to Jesus Christ; for if from going forth of
      the commandment in the time of Artaxerxes Longimanus, until the coming of
      the Messiah, there were to be seven weeks or forty-nine years, how does
      this agree with what follows? "After threescore and two weeks (or three
      hundred and seventy-four years) shall Messiah be cut off." And again, "He
      shall confirm the covenant with many for a week." Did then Jesus Christ
      live four hundred and twenty-three years, or are there two Messiahs
      predicted? Dr. Frideaux acknowledges that some parts of this prophecy are
      so injudiciously printed in the English translation of the Bible, that
      they are quite unintelligible; his alteration is in the punctuation, and
      according to it we read, that, <i>from the going forth of the commandment
      to restore and build Jerusalem, to the Messiah, the Prince, shall be seven
      weeks, and threescore and two weeks</i>; and in verse 27, he puts the half
      of the week, instead of the midst. The explanation of the prophecy as thus
      altered, he gives as follows. From the commandment given to Ezra by
      Ar-taxerxes Longimanus, to the accomplishment of it by Nebemiah forty-nine
      years, or the first seven weeks; from this accomplishment to the time of
      Christ's messenger John the Baptist sixty-two weeks, or four hundred and
      thirty-four years; from thence to the beginning of Christ's public
      ministry, half a week, or three years and a half; and from thence to the
      death of Christ, half a week, or three years and a half; in which half
      week he preached and confirmed the gospel with many; in all, from the
      going forth of the commandment, till the death of Christ, seventy weeks,
      or four hundred and ninety years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, we confidently assert that Dr. Prideaux followed his
      fancy, not the original Hebrew, when he altered the punctuation. He is,
      however, justified in the alteration of half of a week; but, granting all,
      let us see how it applies. Did the Messiah come after seven weeks from the
      commandment of Ar-taxerxes Longimanus? The explanation only says, that
      Nehemiah finished the work which Ezra began. What has this to do with the
      Messiah coming at the end of the first seven weeks? The prophet says, that
      after threescore and two weeks, the street and the wall shall be built.
      Again, and previously, that after the commandment for the city to be
      built, the Messiah shall come in seven weeks. The learned divine, on the
      contrary, makes Daniel say, that John the Baptist began to preach the
      kingdom of the Messiah sixty-nine weeks after the commandment, and in the
      first seven weeks he talks of nothing but building the temple. Again, how
      does the oblation cease in half a week? In fact, the same objection occurs
      here, as to the passage as it is written in our Bibles. Daniel speaks
      quite clear, when he says, that "from the going forth of the commandment
      to restore and build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah, the Prince, shall be
      seven weeks." If we find, in whatever explanation of the prophecy, that
      Christ did not come forty-nine years after this commandment, and that he
      did not live four hundred and thirty-four years afterwards, the whole must
      be an untruth. And, if the first period of seven weeks is united with that
      of threescore and two, that is, if the period of rebuilding the city, and
      of the coming of the Messiah be the same, then let divines inform us
      whether this really came to pass, and reconcile it with what follows, in
      ver. 26, that the city is to be destroyed at the same time. Did Christ
      confirm any covenant with many for seven years?
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us attempt to unriddle this enigma. The passage evidently talks of two
      Messiahs, or makes one live upwards of four hundred years; and is
      altogether unintelligible as it stands. For the better understanding of
      it, I shall quote some previous part of the same chapter, ver. 1. "In the
      first year of Darius, the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes,
      which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans. 2. In the first year
      of his reign, I, Daniel, understood by books, the number of the years
      whereof the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would
      accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem. 3. And I set my
      face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayers and supplications, with
      fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes. 4. And I prayed unto the Lord my God,
      and made my confession, and said." After this follows his prayer, until
      the 20th verse; and, in the 21st the angel began to unfold a prophecy to
      Daniel, which begins in verse 24, and he promises to explain the mystery
      that had so much grieved Daniel, that is, the prophecy of Jeremiah; then
      follows the passage I have quoted: the alterations I conceive ought be
      made in the reading of which, I now proceed to mention. In verse 25, the
      sentence stops after the seven weeks, as it is in the English Bible,
      because in the original we find here the stop Atnach. In verse 26, instead
      of, <i>shall Messiah be cut off?</i> we ought to read, <i>the oblation
      shall cease</i>. This is the real meaning of the expression in the
      original, according to Tertullian, Eusebius, and Theodoretus. Eusebius
      says, <i>Unctum (vel Christum) nihil aliud esse quam successionem
      Pontificum, quos unctos nominare S. Literae consueverunt.</i> The Hebrew
      properly signifies <i>perdetur unctio</i>. Theodoretus understands by this
      word, the same as <i>sacerdotes uncti. Excidetur unctus,</i> signifies the
      same as the <i>oblation shall be abolished</i>; for the verb <i>excido</i>
      does not always signify to kill, but is applied to whatever falls into
      disuse that was once in practice, or any thing that perishes. It is in
      this sense used in many parts of Kings and Chronicles. Samuel says, <i>excidi
      de altare</i>. In Jeremiah, chapter xxxvii. ver. 18, the verb is used in
      the same sense, <i>non de sacerdotibus Levitis excidet ur homo coram me</i>,
      which is given in English, "neither shall the priests, the Levites, <i>want
      a man</i> (or cease to have a man) before me." In verse 27, "and he shall
      confirm the covenant with many for one week," means no more than the
      exemption of calamities, and is tantamount to, <i>he shall let many remain
      in peace</i>, as in Genesis, chap. vi. ver. 18, it is used in this sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      To understand the real meaning of this pretended prophecy, the reader will
      remember, that Daniel mourned for the 70 weeks of captivity prophesied by
      Jeremiah; the vision of Daniel took place in the first year of Darius,
      King of Chaldea, that is, in the year 162 of Nebuchadnezzar; but, in chap.
      x. of Daniel we learn, that he ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh
      and wine into his mouth, till three whole weeks were fulfilled. Now, the
      term weeks is used in the Bible indiscriminately for weeks of years, or of
      days; here it appears clear it signifies the former, particularly as the
      whole relates to the 70 years of Jeremiah; and the angel, in chap. x. ver.
      14, tells Daniel, in the same figurative style, "Now I am come to make
      thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days, for yet
      the vision is for many days." If then Daniel wept three weeks of years, or
      21 years, from the destruction of the temple, in the year 141 to the time
      of the vision in 162, (the angel, chap. x. ver. 13, says, that the prince
      of Persia withstood him 21 days, or years), it is easy to see what Daniel
      means. Jeremiah had prophesied a captivity of 70 years, of these, three
      weeks or 21 years were past; therefore Daniel, after entreating God to
      tell him "how many more years were wanting," received for an answer what
      follows, "At the beginning of thy supplications, the commandment came
      forth, and I am come to show thee."&mdash;"Seventy weeks are determined
      upon thy people to seal up the vision and prophecy," that is to complete
      the prophecy of Jeremiah; and we find,-therefore, that from the issuing
      the commandment to restore the Jews, and to build Jerusalem, or more
      properly from the revelation of the angel, (exitu Verbi), promising that
      Jerusalem should be rebuilt, ver. 23, to the coming of the Messiah, the
      prince, or Cyrus, who freed the Jews from the captivity, there were to be
      seven weeks, or 49 years, which, added to the three weeks already past,
      made the 70 years of Jeremiah. Cyrus is by Isaiah called the Lord's
      anointed: "Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand
      I have holden, to subdue nations before him for Jacob my servant's sake."
      Cyrus gave, at that time, liberty to the Jews, as the reader may see in
      Ezra. It is evident, that the word commandment cannot mean any express
      order to build Jerusalem, for the angel says, just before he reveals the
      prophecy, "at the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came
      forth we know that Daniel began to address prayers unto heaven, at a time
      when there was no order to build the temple, on the contrary, the Jews
      were in captivity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the most difficult part of the pretended prophecy, the remainder
      is plain. There shall be 62 weeks till the rebuilding of the wall. The
      writer alludes here to the building of the first temple under Zerubbabel
      and Jeshua, and then to the rebuilding of the wall, and restoration of the
      temple by Judas Maccabeus, after its profanation by Antiochus Epiphanes.
      The period of this last event is by the prophecy made to extend to 63 1/2
      weeks, or 444 years. Let us see if chronology confirms this supposition.
      The temple was destroyed in the 141st year of Nabuch, or 4107 of the
      Julian period; add to this 444 years, or 63 weeks and a half, and we have
      the year 4551, or the second year of Judas Maccabeus, according to
      Josephus; who also informs us, that having conquered his enemies, he then
      built a wall about Sion, which is clearly meant in the words, "the street
      shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times," 1 Maccab.
      chap. iv. ver. 60. At that time also "they builded up the mount Sion with
      high walls," &amp;c. Troublous the times certainly were; the Jews were
      fighting against the cruelty of Antiochtis Epiphanes. It is certain then,
      that after 343 years, or 69 weeks, the wall should be built, and although
      it was not really completed till about ten years after, it is presumable
      that the loose historian, or prophet, did not choose to alter the
      beautiful idea of 70 Weeks. We know how superstitiously the Jews respected
      not only the number 7, but all its different affections. We are besides
      informed, in the first book of Maccabees, that after the first depredation
      of Antiochus, the people rebuilt the city of David, and made walls and
      forts; this happened some years before the building of the wall by Judas,
      and brings the prediction nearer to historical accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next part of the prophecy is, "And after threescore and two weeks
      shall sacrifices cease;" this means in the course of the week that
      succeeds the 62. And, no doubt, Antiochus Epiphanes abolished them in the
      seventh year of his reign, as we read in I Maccab. chap. i. "And the
      people of the prince that shall come, shall destroy the city and the
      sanctuary." This Antiochus most certainly did, "and went up (Antiochus)
      against Israel and Jerusalem with a great multitude, and entered proudly
      into the sanctuary, and took away the golden altars, also he took the
      hidden treasures, and there was great mourning in Israel," 1 Maccab. J.
      "And the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war
      desolations are determined." The coming of Antiochus into Jerusalem is
      pompously detailed in the first book of Maccabees: the Jews compared a
      great calamity, or an invading and irresistible army, to a flood. Let us
      proceed with the remainder: "And he shall confirm the covenant with many
      for a week," this alludes to the first seven years of the reign of
      Antiochus, during which he did not interfere with the worship of the Jews,
      although he gave liberty to those who chose to be heathens to follow their
      respective worship: it was in the end of the sixth, and in the beginning
      of his seventh year that he attacked the Jews, destroyed the temple,
      plundered it of its riches, and made himself the tyrant of Judea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last part of the passage is as follows: "And in the half of a week he
      shall cause the oblation and sacrifice to cease," and, I have only to
      observe, that, from the taking of the city by Antiochus, to the absolute
      forbidding Jewish worship, there elapsed about three years and a half, or
      half a week, for he came to Jerusalem in the 143d year of the kingdom of
      the Greeks, and the erecting of idols was in the year 145; after which, he
      continued to persecute the Jews, and promote idolatry, until the year 148.
      Now Antiothus attacked Jerusalem at the end of his sixth year, to which,
      if we add two years and three months, we have pretty exactly the period of
      half a week, or three years and a half. The expression, "the spreading of
      abominations," evidently alludes to what is said in Maccabees, chap. i.
      ver. 34. "Now the fifteenth day of the month Casleu, in the 145th year,
      they (the followers of Antiochus) set up the abomination of desolation
      upon the altar, and builded idol altars throughout the cities of Judah, on
      every side." Daniel says, chap. xii. ver. 11, speaking of his vision, "and
      from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away, and the
      abomination that: maketh desolate set up, there shall be (that is between
      the first interdict of Antiochus, and the setting up of idols) 1290 days;"
      which is a little more than three years and a half. The wonderful prophecy
      is then unriddled, it becomes a contemptible piece of history in an
      affected style. I trust the explanation which I have given, after Marsham,
      will appear satisfactory. I challenge Bishop Watson to produce a plausible
      explanation of the passage according to the sense of the church. It may
      not be improper to observe, that Clemens Alexandrinus, many of the
      fathers, Calmet, and other persons of great knowledge, have flatly denied
      the application of the weeks of Daniel to Jesus. Those who espouse your
      cause lose sight of the context of Daniel, they forget chronology, and
      evince to what a pitch of delusion their minds have arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the famous prophecy that silenced the Jewish rabbins of Venice; it
      is of a pattern with Daniel's four beasts; the fourth is also a story of
      Antiochus Epiphanes and Judas who slays the beast. Judas is the son of man
      coming in clouds; he is the person of whom the prophets speak, and who has
      most ridiculously been distorted to Jesus Christ. This farrago of
      prophecies seems to have been the production of Esdras or some very late
      writer; and I am not sure, but the doctrine of the Pythagorean millennium
      gave rise to some of the expressions in both writers, about the beasts:
      they seem to have sprung from the same origin with those of the
      Apocalypse; and with the four Indian horses, they crept among the Jews,
      together with many other Chaldean mythological ideas: the Ancient of
      Ancients appears in his fiery car as Osiris triumphant, or Chreeshna
      conquering Chiven; the books are opened before him, as his kingdom is
      everlasting, like that of Vishnu with the Vedams. But visions so
      ridiculous as that of Daniel deserve not our consideration; whatever be
      their source they are but reveries, and may serve to amuse idle people in
      their ridiculous speculations about the world's end. Like Swedenburgh, men
      may dream, and interpret their own dreams, and like him have the
      mortification to be laughed at for the non-accomplishment of their
      predictions. We have had of late another Daniel in Mr. Brothers; he too
      saw beasts, and, what is more, he understood their meaning; but
      unfortunately we are not Jews, and he is cruelly imprisoned in a madhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now followed your animadversions on the objections of Thomas Paine
      upon the Old Testament; and I trust I have shown that you have in no
      degree been a more successful labourer in the cause of Judaism than your
      predecessors; even your wonderful prophecy of Daniel is converted into a
      mere historical tale, and the application Jesus Christ makes of it to
      himself is accordingly proved to be ridiculous, the more so, as it comes
      from the Son of God. I have a few more observations to make, before I
      leave this book. I cannot pass in silence the gross blunder you have
      committed, when you refer Mr. Paine to Ferguson for an astronomical proof
      of the miracle of the total darkness at the crucifixion of Jesus. An odd
      conceit, upon my word! You might know that the event is omitted by all the
      authors of eminence who wrote at that time; that even Pliny passes it
      unnoticed. Lest you should mislead the reader with your groundless
      assertions, I shall state the matter as it stands in reality. You avoid
      learned disquisitions to be intelligible, but you ought not to have been
      so deficient of authority, where it is most needed. Besides the gospels,
      the darkness is not mentioned in any author; but divines have attempted to
      prove the event from a supposed passage of Phlegon, related by Eusebius;
      it is in the following words: "In the fourth year of the two hundred and
      second Olympiad, there was the greatest eclipse ever seen; it was night at
      six, and even the stars could be seen." This passage has long been
      disregarded by men of knowledge; it alludes to an eclipse, not to a
      miraculous darkness. Both Mr. Ferguson and you have blundered in
      chronology and astronomy. It is certain, in the year of Christ's
      crucifixion, according to the common chronology, there could have been no
      eclipse of the sun visible at that time at Jerusalem; Ferguson, therefore,
      concludes it a miracle. But you ought to have known, that the fourth year
      of the two hundred and second Olympiad, is not the year of the crucifixion
      in any system of chronology; that there was an eclipse of the sun, in the
      year mentioned by Phlegon, in the month of November, which, however, was
      not central; and you know that Jesus is said to have died at the time of
      the full moon in March, or in the beginning of April. Besides, had even
      such a darkness taken place, are you ignorant of the existence of comets,
      and would not one passing between the earth and the sun eclipse that
      luminary? Have not such miracles taken place if we credit historians? The
      death of Caesar was preceded by wonderful prodigies, and a comet made its
      appearance immediately after. The supposed miraculous influence of comets,
      and their being prophetic signs, was once an article of faith throughout
      all Europe, and the ancient history of every country records many events
      which the authors maintain arose from comets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your reflections on prophets I cannot pass unnoticed. You pretend to make
      a distinction between dreamers, and impostors, and true prophets. You
      acknowledge the number of soothsayers and fortunetellers among the Jews;
      but you maintain that they were altogether distinct from the true
      prophets, and appeal to Jeremiah, who puts the Jews on their guard against
      false prophets. Does not every quack, every impostor, do the same, and
      caution the world to beware of counterfeits? You might have saved a great
      deal of trouble, had you condescended to produce your proofs of the
      genuineness of the writings of the prophets; and then we might enquire
      concerning the works of these augurs. You pretend that a sure mark of the
      reality of a prophet is his predicting bad things, for a fortune-teller
      always prophecies good. Pardon me if I suppose you a follower of Mr.
      Brothers. For surely the destruction of London was not a most desirable
      event. It is in vain you attempt to turn Mr. Paine into ridicule for his
      definition of a prophet. He most justly calls them strolling-poets,
      fortune-tellers; being in Judea what the gipsies, the augurs, and the
      astrologers have been in other nations. The Hebrew word <i>Navi</i>
      signifies nothing but an orator, a public speaker, and is by the Jews
      applied, in a forced way, to soothsayers and diviners. It is
      incontrovertible that they existed among the Jews in colleges, and were
      brought up to the business. Their chief employment was to write the
      chronicles of the times. The name prophet is given in the Bible
      indiscriminately with that of holy man. Among the Hebrews, the first book
      of Kings was called the prophecy of Samuel. Abel is called repeatedly in
      the New Testament a prophet, (see Matth. chap. xxiii. ver. 31 and 35, and
      Luke chap. xi. ver. 50 and 51), although we have no account of his having
      predicted any. Among the Jews there certainly were fortune-tellers,
      necromancers, and witches, all of which you rank among the impostors. But
      had not the witch of Endor a real power of incantation? Did she not most
      wonderfully raise up the spirit of Samuel? Or are we to look upon the
      story of the witch of Endor in the same light as those of modern witches?
      That the prophets of the Jews were repeatedly deceived, we cannot have the
      smallest doubt when 400 of these gentlemen told a downright lie to Ahaz.
      But you have a very easy expedient in all these cases. When a prophet
      tells a lie, you may, as was done in this particular case, attribute it to
      a design of God to cheat the person who consults his oracles, just as
      Jupiter did of old to Agamemnon when he sent him the false dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      You reproach Thomas Paine for want of candour. He has not, you say,
      examined the general design of the Old Testament There he would find the
      benevolence of the God of the Jews, and his infinite goodness in selecting
      them from among the nations, in preserving them from idolatry. If he chose
      this people he has certainly exposed them to continual sufferings, and all
      for no other purpose than to teach mankind that idolatry is the greatest
      of crimes; that to avoid it, murder, plunder, the crusades, the
      inquisition, persecution, may all be laudable means for the preservation
      of the faith of nations. Thus, the cherished people, who were most
      intimate with their God, committed the most enormous crimes, under the
      pretence of preserving pure their adoration of the implacable God Jehovah.
      Did not all the endeavours of Jehovah to rescue nations from idolatry
      prove fruitless? This despicable creature man has been able to effect what
      mighty Jehovah never accomplished. Science is the only antidote against
      all kinds of superstition. Did Cicero adore stocks or stones? Or did ever
      any learned man among the heathens humble himself before idols? Has not
      the principal branch of the church of Christ been notorious idolaters? But
      what avails all this? Have you proved that the Heathens "emulated in the
      transcendent flagitiousness of their lives, the impure morals of their
      gods?" You assert it; but unluckily it is one of the many unsupported and
      assumed propositions in your pamphlet. Did nations necessarily imitate the
      conduct of their gods, I would tremble at being among the followers of the
      bloody Jehovah. The heathens were certainly dreamers in their adoration of
      the planets; we are taught by science, that these bodies resemble our
      earth in the general laws that govern them. It was natural for rude men to
      gaze at the sublimity of the stupendous fabric, the refulgency of the sun;
      the blessings derived from his genial influence could not be contemplated
      without admiration by the amazed and fearful savage. Idolatry is
      ridiculous: but have you proved that Jehovah deserves more to be revered
      than the Great Whole of nature, whether called Pan, or otherwise disguised
      in emblems, than the harmony of the planets designed by symbols, the
      generative powers by Venus, or the vivifying light emanating from the
      bright orb of Apollo? Confess at least, that the allegorical adoration of
      nature could only deceive the multitude who were kept in ignorance by
      their priests. If you are candid, you must acknowledge, that the
      Polytheists were tolerant, that the Atheists or Deists lectured close, to
      the temple. They did not exterminate nations, establish inquisitions,
      murder unbelievers as the Jews, and the Christians; although, as you
      observe, they received the gift of God through Jesus Christ, and were made
      alive by the covenant of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what consists the superiority of the Jewish or Christian notions of
      God? Jehovah is a being incomprehensible; he is a jealous and a revengeful
      God, he hardens men's hearts, and sacrifices whole nations to a particular
      people, who, in their turn, are sacrificed for the boasted scheme of
      general good, which is never the nearer being accomplished. He must be
      adored and revered, and yet he does not make himself known to man. He does
      not even show himself face to face to any but Moses. You pay no great
      compliment to his omnipotence, when you observe, that "probably he could
      not give to such a being as man a full manifestation of the end for which
      he designs him, nor of the means requisite for that end;"&mdash;and, "that
      it may not be possible for the Father of the universe to explain to us,
      infants in apprehension, the goodness and the wisdom of his dealings with
      the sons of man." Jehovah, in short, equally the offspring of fancy with
      the Heathen Jupiter, is as cruel as Moloch, and, like other productions of
      the brain, an invisible phantom, to which priests give the passions of a
      tyrant; and, in their desire that he should reign alone, that men should
      not worship other deities, his ministers have preached up this God, and
      the multitude, eager to admire what they cannot comprehend, have followed
      the mandates of the pretended interpreters of his will. Still, however,
      the greatest number of ignorant men are, and will ever be, idolaters; in
      vain their spiritual guides preach up incomprehensible and ideal beings in
      an unintelligible jargon; man will always seek to satisfy his senses. Even
      the immediate presence of Jehovah, and his horrid massacres, could not
      prevent the favourite nation from following other gods. Even the inspired,
      the wise, the royal Solomon forsook "the God of Israel, holy, just, and
      good," for "the impure rabble of heathen Baalim."
    </p>
    <p>
      According to your nations, according to the doctrines of the Jewish and
      the Christian churches, the sole aim of God has been to be exclusively
      adored, and jealousy is his prominent feature. It is not in the pursuit of
      knowledge, or in the practice of morality that he delights. The precepts
      of social virtue occasionally scattered through the Old, as well as the
      New Testament, can make little impression when contrasted with the
      vindictive cruelty of the Deity. The Jewish Jehovah requires nothing of
      his followers but their compliance in executing his bloody commands
      against nations whom he calls impious, because he has not revealed himself
      to them. The man after his own heart, is the murderer of thousands of
      innocent people. Christ orders his followers to despise the reason he has
      given them, to avoid pleasure, to hate the world, and to love pain, to
      pray, and to spend their lives in continual mortification, and in gazing
      over unintelligible mysteries to acquire his kingdom. If they fail to
      believe in him, whether from ignorance or from conviction, he punishes
      them with eternal damnation, or as <i>Saint</i> Athanasius emphatically
      expresses it in his celebrated creed, "Whosoever believeth in these things
      shall be saved; and whosoever believeth not shall be damned."

      LETTER VII.
    </h2>
    <p>
      I now bring under review a few passages from <i>Holy Writ</i>, which I
      leave to your Lordship to explain, and which scoffers pretend to say are
      undeniable proofs of the stupidity of the Jews, and gross ideas they had
      of God. I shall follow the order of the books without attempting an
      arrangement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Genesis, chap. iii. ver. 1. "Now the serpent was more subtle than any
      beast of the field which the Lord had made; and he said unto the woman,
      yea hath God said," &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p>
      This Mr. Serpent would make a fine figure in Æsop's fables. They say it
      means the Devil, but how does that appear?
    </p>
    <p>
      In ver. 22. and 23. "And behold the Lord said, the man is become one of
      us, (i. e. one of us Gods), to know good and evil, And now lest he put
      forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for
      ever; therefore, the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to
      till the ground from whence he was taken."
    </p>
    <p>
      This shows strongly that boasted attribute of God, Jealousy. Is it
      consistent with a Deity to punish this pair, and all their progeny, for
      their attempt to know good from evil? We here find that the priests have
      made God expressly after their own image. God's selfishness prevented men
      from eating of the other tree, which would make him live for ever. <i>Queritur,</i>
      then, at what period of the world did the soul of man become immortal? Was
      it not till Jesus Christ came? And was this tree a type of him, as the
      bread and wine are at this day? It appears also, that it was not one, but
      two trees, that were prohibited!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ib. chap. xxxii. ver. 24. "And Jacob was left alone, and there wrestled a
      man with him, until the breaking of the day; (this shows the antiquity and
      high authority of sparring); and when he saw that he prevailed not against
      him, he touched the hollow of his thigh (Mendoza like): and the hollow of
      Jacob's thigh was out of joint, as he wrestled with him. And he said, let
      me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I will not let thee go, unless
      thou bless me. And he said unto him, what is thy name? And he said, Jacob.
      And he said, thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel; (which,
      in Chaldee signifies seeing God); for as a prince hast thou power with God
      and with men, and hast prevailed. (Or, as the Vulgate more correctly
      translates, for if thou hast been to oppose the Lord, how much more shall
      thou prevail against men). And Jacob called the name of the place Penial:
      for I have seen God face to face." This passage requires no comment.

      Exodus, chap. iii. ver. 4. "And when the Lord saw that he (Moses) turned
      aside to see, God called unto him out of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses.
      And he said, here am I." This is a pretty play at bo-peep.

    <p>
      Ib. ver. 14. "And God said unto Moses, I am that I am; and he said, thus
      shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am hath sent me unto you."

      Divines hold this passage to be a great instance of sublimity!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Ib. ver. 21. "And I will give this people favour in the sight of the
      Egyptians, and it shall come to pass, that when ye go away, ye shall not
      go empty, but every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, jewels of silver,
      and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and
      your daughters, and ye shall spoil the Egyptians."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the Jews made God after their own image; and the dealings of that
      nation in silver, gold, and clothes, at this day, show that they have not
      forgotten their God. It is not easy for divines to reconcile this with
      God's other precept in the eighth commandment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ib. chap. iv. ver. 24. "And it came to pass by the way in the inn, (by the
      way, were there inns then in Egypt?) that the Lord met him (Moses) and
      sought to kill him!!! Then Zepporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the
      foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet."
    </p>
    <p>
      This business of the circumcision is brought in rather by the head and the
      shoulders, and the cause of it is not quite clear; but it is very evident
      that the Lord could not kill Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ib. chap. xxxii. ver. 27. "And he (Moses learning that the Jews had made a
      golden calf), said unto them, (the sons of Levi, i.e. the priests,) thus
      saith the Lord God of Israel, put every man his sword by his side, and go
      in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his
      brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour; and the
      children of Levi did according to the word of Moses, and there fell of the
      people that day about three thousand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ib. chap. xxxiii. ver. 9. "And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the
      tabernacle, the pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle,
      and the Lord (who was in the pillar) talked with Moses."
    </p>

      In this manner modern goddesses stop their carriages at shop-keepers'
      doors at this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ib. ver. 90. "And he (God) said, thou canst not see my face, for there
      shall no man see me and live." God must here have forgotten his dialogue
      with Adam and Eve, his wrestling with Jacob, and conversations with Moses.
      In Numbers, chap. xii. ver. 6 and 8, he says, "Hear now my words: If there
      be a prophet among you, I, the Lord, will make myself known to him in a
      vision, and will speak to him in a dream," but, "with thee (Moses) will I
      speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches, and the
      similitude of the Lord shall you behold."
    </p>
    <p>
      Ib. chap. xxi. ver..5. "And the people spoke against God, and against
      Moses, wherefore have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the
      wilderness, for there is no bread, neither is there any water, and our
      soul loatheth this light bread." No wonder the Jews tired of living upon
      manna without water, but the Lord taught them not to grumble. "And the
      Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people, and
      much people of Israel died." When God was tired of making his serpents
      bite the poor devils, he said unto Moses, "Make thee, a fiery serpent, and
      set it upon a pole, and it shall come to pass, that every one that is
      bitten when he looketh upon it shall live." This is below all the tricks
      of necromancers.

    <p>
      Ib. chap. xxv. "And the people began to commit whoredom with the daughters
      of Moab. And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the
      Lord was kindled against Israel. And the Lord said unto Moses, take all
      the heads of the people, and hang them up before the Lord against the sun,
      that the fierce anger of the Lord may be turned away from Israel. And
      Moses said unto the judges, slay every one of these men who were joined
      unto Baal-peor. And behold one of the children of Israel came, and brought
      unto his brethren a Midianitish woman, in the sight of Moses, &amp;c. And
      when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he
      rose from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand; and he
      went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both of them
      through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly, so the plague
      was stopped from the children of Israel, and these that died in the plague
      were 24,000." As a reward for this, the Lord gave Phinehas the everlasting
      priesthood, "because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for
      the children of Israel."

      Ib. chap. xxvi. Dathan, Korah, and Abirim strove against Moses and Aaron,
      and the earth swallowed them up, and the fire devoured 250 men.
    </p>
    <p>
      lb. chap. xxxi. ver. 16, there was a plague among the congregation of the
      Lord, on account of the tres pass against the Lord, when he ordered thus,
      "Now, therefore, kill every male among the little ones, and kill every
      woman that hath known man by lying with him; but all the women children
      that hath not known man by lying with him, keep for yourselves." For the
      observation on this passage, I refer my reader to Bishop Watson, and the
      former part of this work.

      The following ought to be the fate of all idolatrous people, and has been
      happily practised in the discoveries made by most European nations.
      Deuteronomy chap. xiii. ver. 13. "Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants
      of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all
      that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua, chap. vi. v. 21. "And they utterly de-, stroyed all that was in
      the city, (Jericho), both man and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep,
      and ass, with the edge of the sword. And they burnt the city with fire,
      and all that was therein: only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels
      of brass, and of iron, they put it into the treasury of the house of the
      Lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Chap. x. Joshua being attacked by five kings, and they having taken
      shelter in a cave, he caused great stones to be rolled to the mouth of the
      cave, till he followed and destroyed the people, then he ordered the five
      kings to be brought out from the cave, "And it came to pass, that when
      they brought out those five kings unto Joshua, that Joshua called for all
      the men in Israel, and said unto the men of war, come near, put your feet
      upon the necks of these kings, and they came near, and put their feet upon
      the necks of them. And afterwards Joshua smote them, and slew them, Joshua
      took Makdekah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king
      thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein;
      he let none remain." And so he did in all to 31 kings, as related in this
      and the following chapters, and all this by the express command of God,
      who made the sun and the moon both stand still to witness these unprovoked
      atrocities. But this was just; God having given that country to his chosen
      people the Jews, as in latter times his vicegerent the Pope gave America
      to the Portuguese and Spaniards, who, Joshua-like, exterminated the kings
      and people, because they were not Christians. This, as you say, serves the
      general scheme of God's benevolence towards mankind.

    <p>
      Judges, chap.i. ver. 4. And the Lord having delivered the Canaanites and
      the Perizzites into the hands of Judah, "They slew of them in Bezek 1000
      men. But Adonibezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and
      cut off his thumbs, and his great toes." lb. ver. 19- "And the Lord was
      with Judah, and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain, but <i>could
      not</i> drive out the inhabitants of the valley!" Why? "Because they had
      chariots of iron." Chap. iv. recounts the manner in which Deborah and
      Barak delivered Israel from Jabin and Si-aera. Ver. 21. Then Jael,
      Hebber's wife, (to whose tent Sisera had fled), "took a nail of the tent,
      and a hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail
      into his temples, and fastened it into the ground, (<i>a goodly nail</i>),
      for he was fast asleep and weary, so he died." Chap. 5, contains the <i>beautiful</i>
      song of Deborah and Barak, which I particularly request my reader to
      peruse, as a finished piece of scripture praise of good words. Chap. xxi.
      relates, that the Israelites having sworn not to give their daughters to
      the Benjamites, and the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead not having come up to
      Minzeh, "the congregation sent 19,000 men of the valiantest, and commanded
      them, saying, go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge
      of the sword, with the women and the children: utterly destroy every male,
      and every woman that hath lain by man;" but, having found 400 young
      virgins that had known no man by lying with any male," they gave them to
      the sons of Benjamin, "and yet so they sufficed them not." So as they had
      sworn not to give them wives of their own daughters, "therefore, they
      commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, go and lie in wait in the
      vineyards, and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloch come out to
      dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch you every
      man his wife."

      First Samuel, chap. vi. The ark of the Lord having been among the
      Philistines seven months, they, unwilling to send it back empty, asked the
      priests and diviners, what they should send in it as a trespass offering?
      "they answered, five golden emerods, and five golden mice,&mdash;-and ye
      shall give glory unto the God of Israel,&mdash;and make a new cart, and
      take two milch kine, and take the ark of the Lord and lay it on the cart;"
      and they did so, "and they of Beth-shemesh lifted up their eyes, and saw
      the ark, and rejoiced to see it,&mdash;and the men of Beth-shemesh offered
      burnt-offerings, and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto the Lord,&mdash;and
      he smote the men of Beth-shemesh, because they had looked into the ark of
      the Lord, even he smote of the people fifty thousand and threescore and
      ten men." Gracious God! Blessed Jews!

    <p>
      Second Samuel, chap. xxiv. ver. 1. "And the anger of the Lord was kindled
      against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, go number Israel
      and Judah." (In first Chronicles, chap. xxi. ver. 1, it stated, "and Satan
      stood up against Israel, and provoked David to number Israel.") And having
      thus instigated David to do what is good policy in a king, God, of his
      infinite mercy, said unto David by his prophet Grad, David's seer, (an
      officer of the household in those days), "I offer thee three things: shall
      seven years of famine come unto thee in thy land, or wilt thou flee three
      months before thine enemies, or that there be three days pestilence in thy
      land?" And David having chosen the latter, "the Lord sent a pestilence
      upon Israel, and there died of the people 70,000 men but the Lord is ever
      merciful, for, "when the angel stretched out his hand upon Jerusalem to
      destroy it, the Lord <i>repented</i> him of the evil, and said to the
      angel that destroyed the people, it is enough, stay thou thine hand," <i>Delirant
      reges, plectuntur Achivi</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 Kings, chap. ii. David being upon his death-bed, having made peace with
      God, and purified his heart, called Solomon to him and gave him his last
      charge. As to Joab, the son of Zeruiah, he said, "do according to thy
      wisdom, and let not his hoar head go down to the grave in peace,&mdash;and
      behold thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, which cursed me, but he
      came down to meet me at Jordan, and I sware to him by the Lord, saying, I
      will not put thee to death by the sword; now, therefore, (<i>proceeds the
      man after God's own heart</i>), hold him not guiltless; for thou art a
      wise man, and knowest what thou oughtest to do unto him, but his hoar head
      bring thou down to the grave with blood." Solomon having succeeded his
      father, the first act of his reign was to put to death his brother
      Adonijah.
    </p>
    <p>
      1 Kings, chap. xi. ver. 4, "Solomon's heart was not perfect with the Lord
      his God, as was the heart of David his father, for it came to pass, that,
      when he was old, his wives turned his heart after other gods." But why go
      through such barbarous details? All along we find imprecations against
      those who despise the prophets, and praises lavished upon murderers,
      traitors, and assassins. This is the people "selected by the wisdom of
      God, that they might witness to the whole world in successive ages his
      existence and attributes, that they might be an instrument of subverting
      idolatry, of declaring the name of the God of Israel throughout the whole
      earth a people, who are to us witnesses of the existence, and of the moral
      government of God."&mdash;This is the Old Testament, which you presume to
      say afforded matter for the laws of Solon, and a foundation for the
      philosophy of Plato,&mdash;which has been admired and venerated for its
      piety, its sublimity, its veracity, by all who <i>are able to read and
      understand it!!!</i> This is the God who maketh the sun to rise on the
      evil and on the good, who is all perfection, all wise, and all powerful,
      and whose mercy is above all his other attributes."
